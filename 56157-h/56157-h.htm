</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The contents of this volume made their first
appearance in the shape of a series of papers from &ldquo;Nether
Lochaber&rdquo; in the <i>Inverness Courier</i>, a well-known Northern
Journal, long and ably conducted by the late Dr. <span class=
"sc">Robert Carruthers</span>. They are now presented to the public in
book form, in the hope that they may meet with a friendly welcome from
a still larger constituency than gave them kindly greeting in their
original shape, as from fortnight to fortnight they appeared.</p>
<p>At one time it was the Author&rsquo;s intention to rewrite and
rearrange all, or almost all, these papers, adding, altering, or
expunging as might be considered best. On second thoughts,
however&mdash;second thoughts, besides, approved of by many literary
and scientific friends, in whose judgment and good taste the Author has
the utmost confidence&mdash;it was resolved to let them retain very
much the form in which they first attracted attention, in the belief
that any good that could result from a rewriting and reconstructing of
them would be dearly purchased if it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e207" href="#xd26e207" name="xd26e207">viii</a>]</span>interfered,
as it was almost certain to interfere, with their <i lang="la">prima
cura</i> directness of phrase and freshness of local colouring.</p>
<p>In a volume dealing so largely with the Folk-Lore of the West
Highlands and Hebrides, there are necessarily many Gaelic rhymes and
phrases which at the first blink may tend to startle and repel the
southern reader. These Gaelic quotations, however, the Author has taken
care to translate into fairly equivalent English, so that even in this
regard it is to be hoped the volume may prove equally acceptable to the
Saxon, who is ignorant of the language of the mountains, as to the
Celt, who knows and loves it as his mother tongue.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The weather [March 1868] with us here still continues
wonderfully genial and mild: taken all in all, the season may be noted
as in this respect perhaps without precedent in our meteorological
annals. The sun, with nearly eight degrees of southern declination, is
not yet half-way through <i>Pisces</i>; we are still three weeks from
the vernal equinox, and yet on our table before us, as we write these
lines, there is as pretty a posy of wild-flowers as you could wish to
see, consisting of daisies, primroses, and other modest beauties, the
&ldquo;firstlings of the year,&rdquo; culled from bank and brae at a
date when in ordinary seasons the country, snow-covered or ice-bound,
is but a bleak and barren waste. Older and wiser people than ourselves
confidently predict &ldquo;a winter in mid-spring&rdquo; as yet in
store for us; but <i lang="la">meliora speramus</i>, we had rather
believe that to one of the mildest winters on record will succeed a
genial spring, a splendid summer, and an abundant harvest. In any case,
as somebody said of Scaliger and Clavius, <i lang="la">Mallem cum
Scaligero errare quam cum Clavio rect&egrave; sapere</i>: I had rather,
that is, be a partaker in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href=
"#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>errors of Scaliger, than a sharer in all
the wisdom of Clavius. Even so, we had rather err with the optimists
than be ranked with the pessimists, even when their predictions turn
out the truest. In our forenoon ramble on Friday last did we not find a
merle&rsquo;s nest in the close and well-guarded embrace of an old
thorn root, with its pretty treasure of four brown-spotted,
greyish-green eggs? and with our wild-flower bouquet before us, are we
not better employed in crooning one of Burns&rsquo; sweetest lyrics
than in predicting evil, even if we were certain that our prediction
should become true?&mdash;said lyric being that entitled <i>The
Posie</i>, which, dear reader, if you do not know it already, you
should incontinently get by heart. Here is a verse or two:&mdash;</p>

tenderness. How it must have irradiated, like a sudden flood of
sunshine over a mountain landscape, the poet&rsquo;s heart as he penned
it! Here you have the germ of the doctrine afterwards more broadly
taught by Coleridge in the well-known lines of the <i>Ancient

</div>
<p class="first">We love <i>The Posie</i> of Burns for its own sake,
but we love it all the more, perhaps, because our attention was first
directed to its sweet simplicity and tender beauty by one of our
earliest and kindest friends, himself a poet of no mean order, the late
Professor William Tennant, author of <i>Anster Fair</i>, in all its
fantastical gaiety and homely mirth the most original poem, perhaps, to
be found in the literature of our country.</p>
<p>A gentleman who resides at present in Cheltenham, a cadet of one of
the oldest and most respectable families on the West Coast, and himself
the head of a house not unknown in Highland story, has been so good as
to send us a short Gaelic poem in manuscript, with a request that we
should give an English version of it. With this request we very readily
comply, such a task being to us a labour of love; the poem itself,
besides, being very beautiful, and the history of its composition
extremely interesting, as throwing some light on the manners and
customs of the olden times. The following prefatory note from the MS.
itself sufficiently explains the origin of this quaint and curious
Hebridean <i>Epithalamium</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;It was the custom in the
West Highlands of Scotland in the olden time to meet the bride coming
forth from her chamber with her maidens on the morning after her
marriage, and to salute her with a poetical blessing called <i lang=
"gd">Beannachadh B&agrave;ird</i>. On the occasion of the marriage of
the Rev. Donald Macleod of Durinish, in the Isle of Skye, this practice
having then got very much into desuetude, and none being found prepared
to salute <i>his</i> bride <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href=
"#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>agreeably to it, he himself came forward
and received her with the following beautiful address.&rdquo; We
present our readers with the original lines <i lang="la">verbatim et
literatim</i>, precisely as they stand in the MS., only omitting two
lines that are partly illegible from their falling into the sharp
foldings of the sheet. The sense and tenor of these lines, however, we
have ventured to guess at and to incorporate with our English
version:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The word <i>breid</i> in the original, which we have
rendered <i>kerchief</i> and <i>coif</i>, was in the olden times the
peculiar head-dress of married females, while virgins wore their
braided locks uncovered, a simple ribbon to bind the hair, and
occasionally a sprig of heather or modest flower by way of ornament,
being the only head-dress that could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6"
href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>with propriety be worn by a maiden
in the good old anti-chignon days of our grandmothers. The Highland
maiden&rsquo;s narrow ribbon for binding the hair was in the south of
Scotland called a <i>snood</i>, probably from the old English
<i>snod</i>&mdash;&ldquo;neat, handsome&rdquo;&mdash;a word still in
use in the English border counties. In the south, even more pointedly
than in the north, the emblematical character of the maiden ribbon or
snood was recognised. It was only when a maiden became an honest,
lawful wife that the coif&mdash;also called <i>curch</i> and
<i>toy</i>&mdash;could be worn with propriety. If a damsel was so
unfortunate as to lose pretentions to the name of maiden, without
acquiring a right to that of matron, she was neither permitted to wear
that emblem of virgin purity, the snood, nor advanced to the graver
dignity of the coif or curch. In old Scottish songs there occur many
sly allusions to such misfortunes, as in the original words of the
popular tune of &ldquo;Ower the muir amang the
heather&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Down amang the broom, the broom,</p>
<p class="line">Down among the broom, my dearie,</p>
<p class="line">The lassie lost her silken snood,</p>
<p class="line">That gart her greet till she was wearie.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And in a verse of a curious old ballad that we took
down some years ago from the recitation of a grey-headed Paisley
weaver&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;And did ye say ye lo&rsquo;ed me weel?</p>

<p class="line xd26e978">Aft brings the saut tear to my ee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The reverend author of the above lines was probably
born about the year 1700, or perhaps ten or twenty years earlier, for
we find that he died a man well advanced in years in 1760. In the
<i>Scots Magazine</i> of that year there is the following notice of Mr
Macleod&rsquo;s death:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Jan. 12th.</i>&mdash;At
Durinish, in the Isle of Skye, the Rev. Donald Macleod, minister of
that parish, a gentleman, says our correspondent, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>who adorned
his profession, not so much by a literary merit, of which he possessed
a considerable share, as by a consistent practice of the most useful
and excellent virtues. To do good was the ruling passion of his heart;
in composing differences, in diffusing the spirit of peace and
friendship, in relieving the distressed, in promoting the happiness of
the widow and orphan, his zeal was almost unexampled, his activity
unmeasured, his success remarkable. It is almost unnecessary to add
that he lived with a most amiable character, and died universally
regretted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A somewhat curious circumstance is the following:&mdash;One of the
Rev. Mr. Macleod&rsquo;s daughters was married to Macleod of Berneray,
she being that gentleman&rsquo;s <i>third</i> wife. Berneray was at the
date of this third marriage seventy-five years of age, notwithstanding
which he became by this lady the father of <i>nine children</i>. He
lived a hale and hearty old man till he was upwards of ninety. He was
reckoned in his day a splendid specimen of the stalwart, sterling,
straight-forward, and chivalrous Highland gentleman, &ldquo;all of the
olden time.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=

<p class="first">With occasional gales of wind and blustering showers
[October 1868], that, from their chilliness and <i>snellness</i>, you
suspect to be sleet, although you don&rsquo;t like as yet exactly to
say so&mdash;meteorological phenomena, however, in no way strange or
unusual on the back of the autumnal equinox&mdash;the weather with us
here continues delightfully bright and breezy, and the country looks
beautiful. Field and upland are still as freshly green as at midsummer,
while the deep, rich russet hues and golden tints of the declining
year, gleaming in the fitful sunlight, and intermingling their glories
with the still beautifully fresh and unspotted foliage of our hardier
trees and shrubs; with the ripe, ruddy bloom of the heather empurpling
the moorland and the hill, and a perfect sea of &ldquo;brackens
brown&rdquo; mantling the mountain side, and fringing, in loving
companionship with the birch, the alder, and the hazel, the
torrent&rsquo;s brink, as it leaps in foam from rock to rock and dashes
downwards with its wild music to the sea,&mdash;all this, with a
thousand indescribable accessories, scarcely perceptible indeed in the
general effect, but all bearing their fitting part in the delightful
whole, presents at this season, and never more markedly than this year,
a scene that you never tire of gazing at, and declaring again and
again, and with all your heart, to be &ldquo;beautiful
exceedingly.&rdquo; As you gaze on such a scene as this, you feel that
no painter could paint it; that there is a something in it all too
subtile and spiritual to be transferred <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>to canvas by any art
whatever. An imitation, indeed, of all that is palpable and tangible
about it you may get, and it may be very beautiful perhaps, and a
triumph of art in a way; but, even as you gaze in admiration, ready to
grant the artist all the praise that is his due, are you not apt,
remembering the scene as nature has it, to</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Start, for <i>soul</i> is wanting
there?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But we must not be misunderstood. Painters and
painting we love, and have always loved, and should be sorry, indeed,
to be considered as in any way dead or indifferent to the power and
beauty of the art. Painting, after all, however, and especially
landscape painting, is but an <i>imitative</i> art, and the longer we
live, and the more we are brought face to face with nature, the more
shall we feel that there is a charm, an attractiveness, and a
loveliness about her all her own&mdash;a <i>something</i> that you feel
but cannot describe, that the artist as he gazes feels too, and strives
to grasp and instil into his picture, but cannot charm into
interminglement with his colours, &ldquo;charm he never so
wisely.&rdquo; Viewed &aelig;sthetically, nature in sooth consists not
of matter only, but of matter and <i>spirit</i>, and therein is the
secret of her surpassing power over us. You may subtly imitate and
reproduce exact representations of her more prominent features and
general outlines, and the painter, according as he is more or less

of the mere manipulation of his subject&mdash;be it landscape,

well as pleasure and delight; but, granting all this, there shall still
be something awanting even in the finest pictures, that something which
we have ventured to call spirit&mdash;the spirit that pervades and
permeates nature in all her works, that is her life, that may be
&ldquo;spiritually discerned&rdquo; <i>in her</i>, but cannot be
transferred to canvas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"

<p>In the collection of Jewish traditions known as the <i>Talmud</i>
there is a very pretty story of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, that
will serve to illustrate our meaning better than the longest
dissertation could be. It is to the following effect:&mdash;Attracted
by his wealth, and wisdom, and power&mdash;the fame whereof had gone
forth into all lands&mdash;the Queen of Sheba, the Beautiful, paid a
visit to Solomon, the Wise, at his own court, that she might there
admire the splendour of his throne and be instructed of his wisdom.
Charmed with the courtesy and gallantry of the accomplished King,
delighted with the magnificence and splendour of his court, and amazed
at his surpassing wisdom, which, indeed, exceeded all that she had
heard reported of it, the Queen still thought that Solomon could be
outwitted, and she resolved to have the glory of puzzling and
outwitting one so wise. To this end she one day presented herself
before the King, bearing in one of her hands a wreath of natural
flowers, the most beautiful she could gather, and in the other a
similar wreath of artificial flowers, the most beautiful and like unto
natural flowers that the cunning of herself and her handmaidens could
fashion. Of the two wreaths the hues were of the brightest, and the
flowers of the one wreath were as if they had been pulled off the same
stalks that bore the flowers of the other. &ldquo;Tell me now, O
King,&rdquo; said the Queen as she stood at some distance from the
throne whereon the monarch sate, &ldquo;Tell me now, O King, which of
these wreaths I hold in my hands is fashioned of artificial flowers,
for one of them is so fashioned; and which of them of natural flowers,
that grew from out the earth, and imbibed their beauty and their
brightness from the sun, for of such of a truth is one of them
formed?&rdquo; And, lo, the King was perplexed and sorely troubled, for
he wist not what answer to make, seeing that the two wreaths were as
like one to another as twin sisters at their mother&rsquo;s breast, or
twin lilies on the same stalk. And the courtiers of the King, and his
princes, and his servants, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>were sorely grieved that the sagacity
of the King should be at fault, and his superhuman wisdom at last fail.
But, lo, the spirit of wisdom came upon the King in his perplexity.
Observing some bees clustering outside, he ordered the window to be
opened, and soon the bees came swarming into the court, and after
hovering for a moment about the one wreath, they straightway left it
and settled upon the other, which observing, &ldquo;<i>That</i>,&rdquo;
said the King, &ldquo;<i>that</i>, and not the other, is the wreath of
the flowers that grew from out the earth and in the sun, and were not
fashioned with hands.&rdquo; And the Queen was mightily surprised at
the exceeding wisdom of the King, and did obeisance unto Solomon,
laying the wreaths of flowers upon the steps of the ivory throne that
was overlaid with gold, and of which there was not the like made in any
kingdom. And the courtiers, and the princes, and the servants of the
King clapped their hands and cried, &ldquo;O King! live for
ever.&rdquo; If we are wise and judge aright, we shall always, like the
bees of Solomon, be attracted by nature rather than by art, however
beautiful. Our doctrine was never, perhaps, so briefly and pithily
enforced as by the Macedonian conqueror on a certain occasion. A
courtier one day asked him to listen to him how well he could,
whistling, imitate the notes of the nightingale. Alexander declined the
proffered musical entertainment with the contemptuous remark,
&ldquo;<i>I have heard the nightingale herself.</i>&rdquo; No wonder
that the would-be melodist slunk away abashed; and such be the fate of
all mere echoers and imitators when at any time they claim more than is
their due, or would have us appraise their pinchbeck at the value of
sterling gold. There is an amount of truth, and a hidden meaning and
beauty, in Byron&rsquo;s lines, that he was himself perhaps unconscious
of in the ribald mood of the moment, when, alluding to the
statuary&rsquo;s art, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>It is astonishing how difficult of thorough eradication are certain
superstitions, if once established amongst a people. Once let the
popular mind become inoculated with error in this shape, and although
times may change and the manners of the people may alter, though a new
tongue even shall have succeeded the language in which the error was
imbibed, and knowledge have spread and civilisation have steadily
progressed, yet there the superstition still lurks, frightened it may
be at the outward light, and, owl-like, ashamed to appear in the
brightness of the blessed sunshine of unclouded truth, but ever ready,
nevertheless, under favourable circumstances, to manifest itself, and
assert its sway over its votaries, like certain fabled medi&aelig;val
philters and potions that when administered are said to have lurked for
years and years in the human system, till, under certain conditions,
their subtle properties were called into active operation, and the
desired effect was produced. A short time ago we spent an evening in
the company of a gentleman from the south of Scotland, a distinguished
antiquary and arch&aelig;ologist, and of wonderful skill in everything
connected with the <i>folk-lore</i> of Scotland, whether of the past or
present. In the course of conversation, &ldquo;over the walnuts and the
wine,&rdquo; our friend surprised us not a little by informing us that
even at this day, in certain parts of the south-western districts of
Scotland, the <i lang="la">Sortes Sacr&aelig;</i> are frequently
resorted to by the people when they are in doubt or perplexity about
anything of sufficient importance in their opinion to warrant their
having recourse to this ancient mode of divination. The <i lang=
"la">Sortes Sacr&aelig;</i> are founded upon the more ancient <i lang=
"la">Sortes Virgilian&aelig;</i>&mdash;Virgilian Lots, a method of
divination which had at least the merit of being extremely simple, and
not necessarily occupying much of the votary&rsquo;s time. What may be
called the literary oracle, as distinguished from vocal oracles, was
consulted in this wise: The operator having before him a copy of
Virgil&mdash;the <i lang="la">sortes</i> were generally confined to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span><i lang="la">&AElig;neid</i>&mdash;opened the
volume <i lang="la">ad aperturam libri</i>, anywhere, at random, when
the first passage that accidentally struck the eye was carefully read
and pondered with as little reference as possible to its immediate
context, and a meaning extracted from it which was supposed to indicate
the issue of the event in hand, and which was to be considered
inevitable and irrevocable as the fates had so decreed. A man with the
knowledge thus obtained could not by any precaution or change of
conduct avert the impending doom, good or evil; he could only put his
house in order, and so arrange matters the best way he could; that if
evil came it might be borne with dignity and patience; if good, that it
might be enjoyed with moderation and devout gratitude to the gods. It
is said that at the outbreak of the troubles that culminated in the
Commonwealth, Charles I. and Lord Falkland found themselves on a
certain day in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, when the latter
jocularly proposed that they should inform themselves of their future
fortunes by means of the <i lang="la">Sortes Virgili&aelig;</i>; and
certainly, read by the light of after events, it must be confessed that
the passages stumbled upon seem singularly ominous of the fate that
overtook both. The passage read by the Martyr King was from the fourth
book of the &AElig;neid, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;At bello audacis populi vexatus et armis,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">How the most pious man of his age, and one of the best
kings that ever adorned a throne, suffered death at the hands of his
rebellious subjects is well known. Poor Lord Falkland&mdash;a young
nobleman of the most estimable character; a poet and man of letters, so
fond of books that he used to say that &ldquo;he pitied unlearned
gentlemen in a rainy day&rdquo;&mdash;fell gallantly fighting for the
royal cause in the battle of Newbury, before he had yet completed his
thirty-fourth year. It is curious to find the eminent poet Abraham
Cowley, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>good man too&mdash;of whom at his death Charles
II. was heard to say that &ldquo;Mr. Cowley had not left a better man
behind in England,&rdquo;&mdash;it is curious, we say, to find him on a
certain occasion seriously referring to the <i>Virgilian Lots</i>, and,
what is more, avowing his firm belief in them! During the Commonwealth,
Cowley was in Paris, where he acted as secretary to the Earl of St.
Albans (then Lord Jermyn), and had a good deal to do with the
negotiations that eventually led to the Restoration. In one of his
letters, speaking of the Scotch treaty then in agitation, he
says&mdash;seriously, observe, and in an official
document&mdash;&ldquo;The Scotch treaty is the only thing now in which
we are vitally concerned. I am one of the last hopers, and yet cannot
now abstain from believing that an agreement will be made; all people
upon the place incline to that union. The Scotch will moderate
something of the rigour of their demands; the mutual necessity of an
accord is visible, the king is persuaded of it. <i>And, to tell you the
truth (which I take to be an argument above all the rest), Virgil has
told the same thing to that purpose.</i>&rdquo; He had evidently
consulted the <i>Virgilian Lots</i>, and a passage presenting itself
that could somehow be twisted so as to point to a favourable issue to
the Scotch business in hand, he accepts the oracle, and in all
seriousness announces his belief in it! When we find a man of
refinement and culture and high moral character like Cowley crediting
such nonsense, can we much wonder at the lengths to which fanaticism
and superstition carried people in those unhappy times? To understand
why Virgil, of all the ancient poets, Roman or Greek, was selected as
the oracle in this mode of divination, we must remember that the
Mantuan bard had the credit amongst his countrymen of having been a
sorcerer or necromancer and prophet as well as a poet, something like
the British <i>Merlin</i>, or our own <i>Thomas the Rhymer</i> and
<i>Michael Scott</i>, only more famous, perhaps. &ldquo;Would the
reader suppose, for example, that the theory of volcanic action is all
a myth, and that it is to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>the magic of Virgil, and to nothing
else, that the south of Italy is indebted for all the earthquakes and
subterranean convulsions that have afflicted it for centuries? Yet so
it is, if we are to credit all the stories of &ldquo;Virgilius the
Magician&rdquo; that were current during the Middle Ages. The
celebrated Benedictine monk, <i>Bernard de Montfaucon</i>, author of
<i lang="fr">Antiquit&eacute; Expliqu&eacute;e</i> one of the most
learned and curious works in existence, repeats the story as it was
told and credited in the Dark Ages. The following is from an old
translation, quoted by Scott in his notes to the <i>Lay of the Last
Minstrel</i>, in illustration of the magical spells attributed to the
Ladye of Branksome Tower. Virgil it seems, among other things, was
famous for his gallantries. On one occasion he fell in love with and
carried away the daughter of a certain &ldquo;Soldan,&rdquo; and the
story proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;Than he thoughte in his mynde how he
myghte marye hyr, and thoughte in his mynde to founde in the middes of
the see a fayer towne, with great landes belongynge to it; and so he
did by his cunnynge, and called it Napells (Naples). And the foundacyon
of it was of egges, and in that town of Napells he made a tower with
iiii. corners, and in the toppe he set an apell upon an yron yarde, and
no man culde pull away that apell without he brake it; and thoroughe
that yren set he a bolte, and in that bolte set he an egge, and he
henge the apell by the stauke upon a cheyne, and so hangeth it still.
And when the egge styrreth so should the town of Napells quake; and
when the egge brake, then shulde the town sinke. When he made an ende,
he lette calls it Napells.&rdquo; Thomas of &ldquo;Ercildoune,&rdquo;
and he of &ldquo;Balivearie,&rdquo; and the two
<i>Merlins</i>,&mdash;for there were two of them, the Merlin of the
Arthurian legends, and <i>Merdwynn Wylet</i>, or Merlin the Wild, who
seems to have been a Scotchman, and whose grave is still pointed out
beneath an aged thorn-tree at Drumelzier in Tweeddale,&mdash;these were
accounted great magicians and &ldquo;pretty fellows in their
day;&rdquo; but what were they to Virgilius the earthquaker, who at
least <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>attained to such an enviable state of
independence, that he is represented as frequently playing at pitch and
toss with the &ldquo;devyl,&rdquo; and cheating and outwitting that
crafty potentate as if he were the veriest greenhorn! The <i lang=
"la">Sortes Sacr&aelig;</i> were just the <i lang="la">Sortes
Virgilian&aelig;</i>, with this difference, that in the former case,
instead of a copy of Virgil, the New Testament was used in the process
of divination. The oracle is consulted in this case, according to our
information, by the introduction at random of the wards end of a key
(some allusion probably to the Apostolic keys) between the leaves of
the closed volume, which is then opened at that place, and from the
first verse that arrests the eye the desired knowledge is extracted. On
inquiry, we find that this superstition was still occasionally
practised in the Highlands of Scotland some fifty years ago, though we
would fain hope and believe that it is now unknown. It is curious that
it should still be frequently resorted to in the south-western
districts. It seems to have been a very general as well as a very
ancient mode of divination. Hoffman, in his <i lang="fr">Lexicon
Universale, &amp;c.</i>, informs us that it was practised by the Jewish
Rabbins with their sacred books, as well as by the Pagans from very
early times, and was common amongst the Christians of the Middle Ages.
We are informed by a gentleman, who spent many years in the East, that
the Mahometans frequently resort to this method of divination, taking
the Koran as their oracle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=

<p class="first">An old Gaelic MS.&mdash;&ldquo;The Bewitched Bachelor
Unbewitched&rdquo;&mdash;Fairy Lore&mdash;Lacteal Libations on Fairy
Knowes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In looking over some old papers the other day [October
1868] we stumbled on some sheets of Gaelic MS. that had lain neglected
for years, and every existence of which, indeed, we had well-nigh
forgotten. One of these sheets contained the original of the following
lines. It is in many respects a curious composition, written in a sort
of rhythmical alliterative prose rather than in verse, somewhat in the
manner of the conversational parts of the Gaelic <i lang=
"gd">Sgeulachdan</i> or fireside tales of the olden time. Its tone
throughout is gay and lively, with an occasional admixture of humour
and <i>double entendre</i> that is very amusing, while its allusions to
the manners and customs and superstitious observances of a past age
render it, to our thinking, extremely interesting. The sheet in our
possession is only a copy, the original, taken down from oral
recitation, we believe, being in a MS. collection of Gaelic poems and
tales by Rev. Mr. M&rsquo;Donald, at one time minister of the parish of
Fortingall, in Perthshire. Having only internal evidence to judge from,
it is impossible with any confidence to assign even an approximate date
to such a production as this, but we are probably not far wrong in
placing it as early at least as the middle or close of the last
century. It bears no title in the original; we may call it&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The English reader will probably require to be
informed that oe&mdash;the Gaelic <i lang="gd">ogha</i>&mdash;signifies
a grandchild, while <i lang="gd">shian</i> (Gaelic <i lang=
"gd">sithean</i>) is a fairy knoll. To show what a power fairies were
at one time in the land, and how wide-spread was the belief in them, we
have only to consider that there is perhaps not a hamlet or township in
the Highlands or Hebrides without its <i lang="gd">shian</i> or green
fairy knoll so called. Within half a mile of our own residence, for
example, there is a <i lang="gd">Sithean Beag</i> and a <i lang=
"gd">Sithean Mor</i>, a Greater and Lesser Fairy Knoll; there is,
besides, a <i lang="gd">Glacan-t&rsquo; Shithein</i>, the Fairy Knoll
Glade, <i lang="gd">Tobar-an-t&rsquo; Shithein</i>, the Fairy Knoll
Well; and a deep chasm, through which a mountain torrent plunges
darkling, called <i lang="gd">Leum-an-t&rsquo; Shithiche</i>, the
Fairy&rsquo;s Leap, with which there is probably connected some very
wonderful story, although we have been unsuccessful hitherto in meeting
with any one able or willing to repeat it. The truth is, that a belief
in fairies and fairyland, or faery&mdash;faint, no doubt, and
ill-defined now-a-days&mdash;still lingers ghost-like, the shadow of
its more substantial former living self, in our straths and glens; and,
in accordance with the old superstition, it is considered that the
&ldquo;good people&rdquo; should only be spoken of on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>rare and
unavoidable occasions, and then only in serious and respectable terms.
Hence it is that you always find old people reluctant to impart such
fairy lore as may be known to them, though garrulous enough on all
other subjects; and hence, also, it happens that in our old <i lang=
"gd">Sgeulachdan</i>&mdash;the <i>Arabian Nights Entertainments</i> of
our Celtic forefathers&mdash;although you find giants, and dwarfs, and
misbegotten beings of every imaginable shape and size; animals, too,
that can speak and reason and lend their superhuman aid to prince and
peasant in extremity, as well as genii, kelpies, and spirits of flood
and fell, you rarely if ever meet with one of the &ldquo;good
folks,&rdquo; or fairies proper, introduced upon the scene. The people
thoroughly <i>believed</i> in them, believed that they had a veritable
existence, and although invisible to mortal eye, that they might be at
your elbow at any moment; that they disliked being spoken of at all as
a rule, and that a disrespectful word about them especially would
inevitably be followed by some signal punishment, or
&ldquo;mischance,&rdquo; as it was more cautiously termed in the
South&mdash;all this they believed, and therefore they held it wisest
to speak of fairies, good folks though they were, as seldom as
possible. The allusion to paying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The fairies their due on the fairy
knowe,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">has reference to the custom, common enough on the
western mainland and in some of the Hebrides some fifty years ago, and
not altogether unknown perhaps even at the present day, of each
maiden&rsquo;s pouring from her <i lang="gd">cumanbleoghain</i>, or
milking-pail, evening and morning, on the fairy knowe a little of the
new-drawn milk from the cow, by way of propitiating the favour of the
good people, and as a tribute the wisest, it was deemed, and most
acceptable that could be rendered, and sooner or later sure to be
repaid a thousand-fold. The consequence was that these fairy knolls
were clothed with a richer and more beautiful verdure than <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>any
other spot, howe or knowe, in the country, and the lacteal riches
imbibed by the soil through this custom is even now visible in the
vivid emerald green of a <i lang="gd">shian</i> or fairy knoll whenever
it is pointed out to you. This custom of pouring lacteal libations to
the fairies on a particular spot deemed sacred to them, was known and
practised at some of the summer shielings in Lochaber within the memory
of the people now living. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=

<p class="first">Transit of Mercury&mdash;Improperly called an
&ldquo;Eclipse&rdquo; of&mdash;November Meteors&mdash;Mr.
Huggins&mdash;Spectrum Analyses of Cometary Light&mdash;Translation of
a St. Kilda Song.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We were early astir on the morning of the 5th November
[1868]; with little thought, be sure, of Guy Fawkes or the Gunpowder
Plot, intent only on witnessing, if we might be so fortunate, the
transit of Mercury over the solar disc. The phenomenon in question we
have seen referred to as an &ldquo;eclipse&rdquo; of Mercury, which it
certainly was not. A celestial body is properly said to be eclipsed
when, by the interposition of another and a nearer orb, it is
temporarily hid from view. A star or planet so hidden by the body of
the moon, for instance, is said to be &ldquo;occulted.&rdquo; The sun
is truly said to be eclipsed when the new moon at a particular
conjunction steps in between us and him, and temporarily intercepts his
beams. What again, for convenience sake, is called an eclipse of the
moon, is really not an eclipse at all, so far at least as the
terrestrial spectator is concerned; it would be more strictly correct
to call it simply a lunar obscuration. The temporary appearance of
Venus and Mercury as circular and sharply defined black spots on the
solar disc, has hitherto always, and very properly, been called in the
language of astronomers a &ldquo;transit&rdquo; of the particular
planet by name, such as the &ldquo;transit of Venus,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;transit of Mercury;&rdquo; and there is no reason to change the
term, for it is expressive and true, which the word <i>eclipse</i>,
applied to such a conjunction, certainly is not.</p>
<p>Be it called what it may, however&mdash;eclipse or transit&mdash;we
were disappointed in not getting a glimpse of the phenomenon in
question <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>on the present occasion. Although duly at our post
from before sunrise till the minute calculated for the last contact of
the planet with the solar disc, we were unable to obtain anything more
than the most momentary blink even of the larger orb, and, of course,
the detection of the black button-like disc of the planet itself, in
such circumstances, was altogether out of the question. The
disappointment, however, was less annoying to us in this instance from
the fact that we had already been privileged to witness all the phases
of a similar conjunction from first to last on the 12th November 1861.
The next visible transit of Mercury does not take place till the 6th of
May 1878&mdash;ten years hence. There are several other transits during
the present century, invisible in our country, however, and on the
continent of Europe; but which will probably afford much delight to
many an eager watcher over the length and breadth of the South American
continent, and generally over the islands of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Nor, with us here at least, was the night of the 13&ndash;14th
instant any way more favourable for observation than the dull beclouded
morning of the 5th itself. The night was calm and rainless, to be sure,
but a heavy impenetrable mass of dark grey clouds, so low as to envelop
all the mountain summits around, obscured the vault from horizon to
horizon, from sunset to sunrise, so that not a single meteor could be
seen by the keenest eye, even if above that pall of cloud the display
had been the most brilliant and splendid conceivable. From the fact,
however, that in several places widely distant from each other, from
which we have had communications on the subject, and where the sky was
abundantly clear and unclouded throughout, no unusual display of
meteors was seen, the probability is that we have on this occasion
missed them in our country, either because they came into contact with
our atmosphere in the daytime, when, of course, they would be
invisible, or more likely because our contact this year with the
meteorolithic <i lang="la">annulus</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>was of the slightest, and
at a segment thereof where the meteoric bodies are least numerous, and
thus we must patiently wait till we again dash through it at its
densest before we can hope for such a magnificent meteor shower as
astonished and delighted us all in 1866. Only at Oxford, as far as our
country is concerned, was there anything like a meteor shower on the
present occasion, and even there the display seems to have been too
faint and uninteresting to have attracted much attention. Intelligence
has reached our country from New York, however, that over that city,
and over the States generally, the meteoric display of the morning of
the 14th was very splendid indeed, though, owing to the morning being
further advanced before it commenced, less of it was seen by the people
at large than on some previous occasions. The weather with our
Transatlantic cousins seems to have been all that could be desired, as
it is stated that &ldquo;astronomers and others were able to make very
complete observations.&rdquo; The worst thing about our insular
position with respect to matters astronomical is the extreme
uncertainty with which anything like continuous observation can be
conducted. The chances always are twenty to one that in Great Britain,
at any given hour in any given place, the weather should be such as to
render an observation of a celestial phenomenon impossible, or at the
least partial and unsatisfactory. One thing, at least, is now pretty
certain&mdash;that annually, and at a date that falls somewhere between
sunset of the 13th and sunrise of the 14th November, we may confidently
look for greater or less displays of these meteoric bodies, the only
thing likely to interfere with the interesting pyrotechnic exhibition
being an unfavourable state of the weather at a moment when we are most
concerned that the sky shall be clear and cloudless.</p>
<p>Mr. Huggins, whose researches with the <i>spectroscope</i> have
already made his name famous, has recently communicated a most
interesting paper to the Royal Society, giving an account of the
spectrum <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>analyses of one of the smaller and commoner class
of comets that was visible for a short time in the month of June last.
Avoiding technical details, which might be uninteresting to some of our
readers, we may simply mention that on testing the nucleus of this
comet with the spectroscope, Mr. Huggins found that it was resolved
into three broad &ldquo;bands,&rdquo; precisely similar to the results
obtained on examining with the same wonderful instrument such carbon as
follows the transmission of electric sparks through olefiant gas. The
conclusion arrived at by Mr. Huggins is, that the nucleus of the comet
in question consisted solely of volatilised carbon. This paper of Mr.
Huggins is altogether a most interesting one, and we may have something
more to say about it on a future occasion.</p>
<p>The following is a translation&mdash;somewhat freely
rendered&mdash;of an old Irst or St. Kilda song, the solitary island
home of a score or two of hardy inhabitants, and by all accounts a
happy and hospitable race too, who cling with an unquenchable love to
their lonely rock, as if it were a perfect paradise, ocean-girt and
storm-beaten though it be&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Placed far amid the melancholy main.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Except another specimen given in a small collection of
Gaelic songs, edited by the late Rev. Mr. M&rsquo;Callum of Arisaig,
the original of the following is the only St. Kilda song that we have
met with. Our copy was procured in this way: Some years ago we were
dining on board H.M. Revenue cruiser &ldquo;Harriet,&rdquo; Captain
M&rsquo;Allister. Going ashore on a fine moonlight night, one of the
seamen who rowed our boat sang the song, which we had no hesitation in
at once declaring to be of St. Kilda origin, which the man admitted was
the case, he having picked it up many years before from an old woman
who had spent some time on the island. Of the air, we can only remember
that it was a wild, irregular sort of chant, very different from the
soft low airs to which our mainland songs are for the most part sung,
with the refrain or burden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>(represented by our
<i>Alexandrines</i> in each stanza) given in a shrill falsetto that was
somewhat disagreeable to the ear, although abundantly appropriate,
probably, in the circumstances in which the song was composed, and when
sung amid all the surroundings of the scene depicted.</p>

obliged to hang suspended from ropes over the most dreadful precipices,
in the clefts and along the otherwise inaccessible ledges of which the

drift of the island maid&rsquo;s very spirited and very earnest song.
It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that as ling, conger, hake, and
grey-fish are certain kinds of sea fish, so fulmar, guillemot,
kittiwake, puffin, and scart are certain kinds of web-footed sea-fowl.

<p class="first">Conscious at last that pouting and inordinate weeping
became him not, and that, being constantly on the
&ldquo;rampage,&rdquo; like Mrs. Joe Gargery, was hardly consistent
with his place in the calendar, April [1869] betimes resolved to
&ldquo;tak a thocht and mend,&rdquo; and now, like Richard, is himself
again&mdash;all sunshine and smiles. The rain-gauge, to be sure, with
stern impartiality, will still show an occasional &ldquo;inch,&rdquo;
or parts of an inch, if you are very particular in your inquiries, when
examined of a morning, but its readings now at least are in no way
appalling, for they represent the warm and genial rainfall of April
showers, that, after all, are as necessary on the west coast at this
moment, and as refreshing to the soil, as the orthodox cup of mulled
port of an evening was believed to be to the weary traveller in the
good old days of stage-coaches and post-chaises. The country, at all
events, is looking very beautiful just now, everything so green and
glad, so fresh and fair, and full of promise of a yet gladder, and
gayer, and brighter day at hand, when the swallow, twittering, shall
dart, a glossy meteor, in the sunlight, and the cuckoo shall challenge
the truant schoolboy to repeat its well-known notes, correctly if he
can. Now is the time to hear our native song-birds at their best,
warbling their sweetest strains, and to decide, once for all, if it be
possible, which you like best; the loud, clear, silvery tinkle of the
seed-shelling finch&rsquo;s rich and rapid song; the liquid and
mellifluous warblings of the soft-billed tribes; or the
soul-entrancing, round, rich, flute-like <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>piping of the throstle,
song-thrush, and merle. How it may fare with the reader who tries to
decide the point we cannot say. For our own part, no decision that we
could ever arrive at could keep its legs for two days together. No
sooner did we decide that the skylark and its congeners had the best of
it, than the goldfinch, with a score of lively cousins to aid and abet,
challenged the verdict, and forced us to acknowledge <i>his</i>
exquisite mastery in song&mdash;an admission made, however, only to be
retracted again almost as soon as made, for in our walk on the evening
of that self-same day did we not stand, and for the life of us
couldn&rsquo;t help standing&mdash;breathless, and hushed, and
still&mdash;to listen to the merle and song-thrush from the
neighbouring copse pouring forth the indescribable riches of their
God-taught vespers as the sun went down; and did we not, then and
there, vow, in utter forgetfulness of finch and skylark, that no music
of earth could for a moment compare, in execution and compass, in
distinctness, and cheeriness, and purity of note, with these matchless
twilight strains? The truth is that no music is equal to
bird-music&mdash;wild-bird music, that is&mdash;in its season, and amid
all its natural surroundings; and the probability is that we shall give
the preference at any time to the melody of one bird over that of
another, not on any well-defined principles of choice or selection in
the matter, but simply in accordance with our own prevailing mood and
temperament of the moment. Such, at least, has been our own experience;
but the reader has every opportunity at this season of studying the
question for himself and deciding. Except that of the nightingale,
perhaps the music of no bird has attracted so much attention by its
beauty and suggestiveness as the merry trill of the skylark&rsquo;s
ascending song. The poets of every country in which it is to be found
have vied with each other in their praises of the only bird that sings
as he soars, and soars as he sings, scaling on quivering pinions the
aerial terraces of heaven, until he can scarcely be discerned, a
music-showering speck against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1853"
title="Source: back ground">background</span> of the blue profound! The
other day we fell in with some curious verses by the French poet Du
Bartas, in which he strives, and not altogether unsuccessfully, to
imitate the merry trill and rhythm of the skylark&rsquo;s
song:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;La gentille alo&uuml;ette, avec son

<p class="line"><i>Vire et desire dire adieu Dieu, adieu

</div>
<p class="first">The last line, if rapidly repeated with the proper
beat and intonation, will be found a really very successful imitation
of the concluding notes of the lark&rsquo;s well-known song. Many of
our readers will remember that the North Uist bard, Ian Mac Codrum, in
his <i lang="gd">Smeorach Chlann-Domhnuill</i>, manages very happily to
imitate the <i lang="gd">smeorach</i> or song-thrush&rsquo;s notes in
the burden or chorus; while Alexander Macdonald&mdash;Mac Mhaighstir
Alasdair&mdash;very naturally falls, like the French poet, into an
imitation of the wild-bird music of the woods and groves in a stanza
that may be quoted not inappropriately at this season:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The lines of Du Bartas have little meaning in
themselves, and are untranslatable, being simply an attempt on the
poet&rsquo;s part, in some odd moment of hilarity and <i>abandon</i>,
to embody the notes of the skylark&rsquo;s song in something like
articulate verse. The general sense of Macdonald&rsquo;s lines
describing the irrepressible inclination of all living creatures to be
jubilant and joyous at the return of spring, cannot better be rendered
than in the first part of Scott&rsquo;s introductory stanza to the
second canto of the <i>Lady of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"

<p class="first">That the people of Lochaber and the Western Isles
should be rejoicing in the advent of heavy rains [August 1869], and
seriously glad at the reappearance of clouds in the heavens and mists
upon the mountain tops, may seem odd enough to those who know anything
of our usual meteorological characteristics; yet true it is, and of a
verity that so it is, for here, as elsewhere, the heat was for many
consecutive weeks intense, and the parching drought and fierce glare of
a summer&rsquo;s sun from a constantly unclouded sky well nigh
unbearable by man or beast, whether in the sheltered valley, where for
days and days no breath of air shook the tiniest leaflet or ruffled the
surface of the sullen tarn, or on the upland moor, where, if breath of
air there was, it was hot and stifling as the breath of a furnace. Were
it not for the occasional sea breezes, that sometimes of an evening
swept over the almost pulseless deep, and copious falls of blessed
night-dews, we should have been badly off indeed. But, as matters have
turned out, we have much reason to be thankful, for if our crops are
not quite so heavy as in average years, they are at least of excellent
quality, and being ripe sooner than usual, we have a chance of getting
them secured in a condition that will add immensely to their value. So
thorough and persistent was the drought even with us, that springs
failed that never before were known to refuse their waters to the
thirsty; and water-courses that heretofore, even in the driest years,
still presented shady pools <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href=
"#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>connected by purling rivulets, were
for weeks together arid and waterless as the course of an ancient lava
stream. As you wandered among the hills you could set your fusee alight
on a stone in a torrent bed over which in ordinary summers rolls a
volume of foaming waters. The demand for beer wherever you went was in
these circumstances something wonderful; and at times, on the arrival
of coach or steamer with its load of panting tourists, the bawling from
husky throats for a supply&mdash;an instant and copious supply&mdash;of
the delicious liquid was sufficiently amusing. One of the happiest
illustrations of the proverbial close treading of the ridiculous on the
heels of the sublime, and the wafer-like thinness of the partition that
divides the sentimental from the absurd, was Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
celebrated parody on the quasi-sentimental style of poetry so much in
vogue in his latter years&mdash;and sooth to say too much in vogue in
our day as well&mdash;a style as unlike the school of Pope as you can
well imagine, and the very antipodes of the sturdily masculine and
didactic strains which Johnson, an intellectual giant&mdash;for there
were giants in these days&mdash;alone accounted true poetry:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">And very well hit off, you will confess; an arrow shot
from an Ulysses&rsquo; bow at the puling whimperers of a namby-pamby
sentimentalism that they miscalled poetry; but if we dared for the
nonce to take these lines in a more serious and literal sense than
their author intended, we should say that in such hot and parching
weather as we have recently had, and are still having, there is more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>&ldquo;bliss&rdquo; in a good draught of
&ldquo;Allsopp&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bass&rdquo; than is dreamt of in the
philosophy of the sentimentalists, and thousands upon thousands of this
season&rsquo;s tourists are ready, we&rsquo;ll be bound, to homologate
this statement.</p>
<p>It was Dr. Johnson, too, if we remember well, who spoke loudly and
dogmatically, as was his wont, of the delightful feeling that one has
in being rapidly whirled along a good road in a post-chaise; and
remembering the unsteadiness of the &ldquo;Rambler&rdquo; on his pins,
and his unwieldy corporation, one can readily understand that he found
the means of locomotion referred to the easiest and most enjoyable
possible. Our own experience of post-chaises has, sooth to say, been
somewhat of the slightest, but in lieu thereof we would recommend a
well-appointed public coach, with sound, well-cared-for horses, a
steady and obliging driver and guard, good roads under foot, and a
bright sky above all; and such a conveyance we on a recent occasion
found the mail-coach between Fort-William and Kingussie to be; and such
a driver and guard, the two in one, is the renowned &ldquo;Davie
Jack,&rdquo; who knows his work, and does it too, in a style that
reminds one of the old &ldquo;Defiance&rdquo; in its palmiest days;
while the weather, if anything, was too fine, too bright and
cloudless&mdash;the best fault it could have, however, since it is
impossible that the weather on any particular day should be faultless,
any more than that any human being should be perfect. Nothing, indeed,
can be finer than the drive through Lochaber and Badenoch to Kingussie,
except perhaps the drive back again. With mountain scenery on all
hands, unsurpassed even in the Highlands for wild, and savage, and
solitary grandeur; with foaming torrents dashing down the steeps,
torrents that at a distance and at this season look like so many
threads of purest silver constantly being absorbed and inwefted with
the river, that, with a voice more hushed, and a quieter, kindlier
step, still gladdens and fertilises the valley as it seeks the sea;
with loch and river scenery the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>attractive and lovely;
and all, in short, that you can reasonably look for of the grand or
beautiful from the sea coast to the central Highlands. With all this,
and the redoubted &ldquo;Davie&rdquo; to handle the ribbons, as only
&ldquo;Davie&rdquo; <i>can</i> handle them&mdash;said
&ldquo;Davie&rdquo; the while as full of anecdote, and joke, and local
tradition as an egg is full of meat&mdash;with all this we say, and
much more that might be mentioned, the man who cannot enjoy such a
journey at this season is little to be envied; for, be his other
qualities and qualifications what they may, his non-enjoyment of such a
drive clearly proves one of two things,&mdash;either he is physically
unwell, and out of sorts, and had better stay at home; or,
&aelig;sthetically, he has no eye for, and no appreciation of, some of
the most splendid scenery in the Highlands, and in that case is less to
be blamed than pitied. Even in winter we should say that this was the
readiest, as well as the most pleasant, line of intercommunication
between the north-western Highlands and the south. It were, finally,
unpardonable in us, who enjoyed it so much, not to mention the very
excellent breakfast on the up-journey, and the equally excellent and
substantial &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; or tea-dinner rather, on returning, to
be had in the shepherd&rsquo;s house at Moy. It may seem unromantic and
prosaic to say so, but it is a fact nevertheless, that one&rsquo;s
appreciation of the sublime and beautiful&mdash;let Mr. Edmund Burke
say what he likes&mdash;is not a little enhanced by a due supply of
creature comforts <i lang="la">pari pass&ucirc;</i>. If one cannot
carry the comforts of home about with him, any more than honest Bailie
Nicol Jarvie could carry about with <i>him</i> the comforts of the
&ldquo;Sautmarket,&rdquo; it is no small matter to meet with good cheer
off a snow-white cloth, with the attentions of a smart, intelligent
serving girl, in odd and out-of-the-way places, where you least expect
it. Altogether, a trip by the Fort-William and Kingussie mail-coach
during the present fine weather is very enjoyable
indeed&mdash;superior, upon the whole, we should say, to the
&ldquo;Rambler&rsquo;s&rdquo; post-chaise, not forgetting that the
latter is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>solitary and somewhat surly sort of business,
whereas in the former you have the chance of pleasant and agreeable
companionship, in addition to its other attractions.</p>
<p>For one to make a discovery, and to <i>think</i> that oneself has
made a discovery, are two widely different things. We readily
acknowledge the distinction. That we have made a discovery we shall not
venture to affirm, but we think we have. Our discovery, if discovery it
be, is this, that Sir Walter Scott is indebted for Dominie
Sampson&rsquo;s &ldquo;prodigious!&rdquo; to Boswell&rsquo;s Life of
Johnson. Who can think of the worthy, kind-hearted, most
unsophisticated, and withal most learned, albeit life-long kirkless
parson, without instantly recalling his favourite exclamation of
&ldquo;<i>Pro-di-gi-ous</i>?&rdquo; We stumbled on our discovery in
this wise:&mdash;A few evenings ago we were reading the third volume of
a very fine edition of Boswell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Johnson,&rdquo; kindly
placed at our disposal by Lady Riddell of Strontian&mdash;and a good
edition of a good book is no small matter to one so far removed from
libraries as we are&mdash;when we came to a page that described
Johnson&rsquo;s meeting with a gentleman who had been his companion at
Pembroke College, Oxford, some fifty years previously. Mr. Edwards, for
that was the gentleman&rsquo;s name, and Boswell accompanied Johnson
home, where, in course of conversation, Mr. Edwards said, addressing
Johnson, &ldquo;Sir, I remember you would not let us say
<i>prodigious</i> at college. For even then, sir (turning to Boswell),
he was delicate in language, and we all feared him.&rdquo; Now, can any
one doubt that it was having his attention particularly called to the
word in this passage that made Scott first ponder the absurdity of
using a word of such volume and import on every trifling occasion, and
caused him, possibly at a long subsequent date (for Scott&rsquo;s
memory, as we know, was <i>prodigiously</i> retentive&mdash;there the
word, you will observe, is pat and appropriate
enough&mdash;prodigiously retentive, we say, of words, phrases, and odd
turns of expression)&mdash;to put it so frequently as an exclamation of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>unspeakable, indescribable import into the mouth
of honest Sampson, whom you can no more help laughing at, at times,
than you can loving him with all your heart <i>always</i>? The matter,
after all, may seem a trifle, and it <i>is</i> a trifle, but such
trifles are dear to the lovers of literature. Were Boswell in the flesh
subsequent to the publication of <i>Guy Mannering</i>, and had his
attention drawn to such a matter, slight as it seems, what a delightful
chapter of gossip he could write about it, with fresh reminiscences of
his long and intimate intercourse with his &ldquo;illustrious
friend,&rdquo; for whom till his dying day he cherished so much
veneration and awe, ever-more mingled with most pardonable pride that
he knew him as no one else knew him, and loved him as no one else loved
him, or perhaps could love him.</p>
<p>We have just been reading our friend Professor Blackie&rsquo;s poem
on &ldquo;Glencoe.&rdquo; The manner in which he &ldquo;goes at&rdquo;
his subject, to use a sporting phrase, the life, and vigour, and
<i>swing</i>, and fervour of the whole, is most refreshing in these
days of poetical (save the mark!) namby-pambyisms, and eminently
characteristic of the learned Professor when at his best. Here you have
him, like a knight of the Middle Ages, high in his stirrups, with lance
in rest, &ldquo;<i lang="gd">Dh&rsquo;aindeoin co theireadh
e!</i>&rdquo; blazing on his shield, and who shall dare to stop his
fierce career against the perpetrators of the foulest deed on record?
Less polished and less artistic than Aytoun&rsquo;s &ldquo;Widow of
Glencoe,&rdquo; it is, nevertheless, the better poem, <i>on such a
subject</i>, of the two. Its very ruggedness and stern headlong force
are its chief charm, they best befit the theme. Blackie is terribly in
earnest; with Aytoun you cannot help feeling it was a mere matter of
sentiment and no more. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"

Display&mdash;Intense Cold&mdash;Birds&mdash;Glanders&mdash;Scribblings
on the Back of One Pound Notes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During a week&rsquo;s pleasant and gentle thaw
[February 1870], we had hoped that the worst of winter was come and
gone; but to our no small disappointment the genial interregnum has
been followed by another heavy fall of snow, and a wonderfully keen and
biting frost, which, borne on the wings of a surly nor&rsquo;easter,
has again bound up the earth as if with fetters of iron. Under such
circumstances the sea-coast, we take it, presents the most dreary and
desolate-looking winter picture imaginable; far more so, to our
thinking, than either moss, or moorland, or mountain range. There is a
something inexpressibly dismal and <i>dowie</i> in the black crape-like
belt of sea beach which divides a landscape deeply clad with snow and
frost-bound, from the dull and leaden coloured deep beyond; the dashing
of the waves of said deep upon the shore, uttering the while a sadly
funereal and dirge-like moan. If our inland friends, in view of the
wintry waste around <i>them</i>, take up the cry of &ldquo;O the
dreary, dreary moorland&rdquo;&mdash;we, dwellers by the sea coast,
have the best possible right to finish the Tennysonian line by
exclaiming &ldquo;O the barren, barren shore.&rdquo; It must, by the
way, have been on some fair <i>summer</i> eve that the Crown officials
first thought of depriving landowners of the sea-shore privileges
hitherto enjoyed by them; had it been in <i>winter</i>, the idea, it
strikes us, would have withered in the bud; they would have fled the
very sight of the dark and dreary &ldquo;foreshore,&rdquo; and wisely
confined themselves to the shelter of their Woods and Forests!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is worthy of record that the present severe snow-storm was
ushered in by a very splendid and in many respects peculiar auroral
display. Shortly after dark on Friday evening, a faint auroral film,
over which an occasional streamer flashed impetuously, over-spread the
northern heavens. All this, however, soon died away, and the north
assumed a cold, clear, frosty aspect. Between seven and eight
o&rsquo;clock many meteors, some of them of great brilliancy and
beauty, were observed to cross and recross the zenith and its
neighbourhood in all directions. Towards the latter hour, however,
these ceased, and all of a sudden, in a very few seconds at most, the
whole celestial hemisphere from E.N.E. to W.S.W.&mdash;from horizon to
horizon&mdash;appeared completely spanned by a magnificent auroral
arch, eight degrees in breadth; like a glorious bridge of a single
semi-circular span, with its edges or parapets of a deep blood-red
colour, and its centre part or roadway of frosted silver; the rest of
the heavens, in all directions, being the while of an inky blue, and
cold and cloudless, without the slightest appearance of anything like
streamers to be seen anywhere. Some idea of the brilliancy of this
auroral arch may be formed from the fact that such bright stars as
Arcturus, Castor and Pollux, Aldebaran, Mars, and others, which lay
along its path, became quite dim, and when located near the centre and
brightest part of the stream, almost invisible. Even Venus, which once
or twice was overlapped for a few minutes by the arch&rsquo;s margin
only, lost all its lustre and sheen, and had a burdened anxious aspect,
as if the forehead and &ldquo;face divine&rdquo; of a mighty
intelligence laboured under the shade of deep and profound thought. For
upwards of an hour did this splendid auroral arch continue to span the
heavens from horizon to horizon, and undergoing little or no change,
until its final disappearance, by what seemed a process of gradual
contraction into itself and towards its terminus in the
east-north-east, whence it started. Such was the very singular meteoric
phenomena by which a severe snow-storm and an amount <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>of cold
almost unparalleled in its intensity was ushered in on the western
sea-board of Scotland in February of the year of grace 1870.</p>
<p>And how fares it with our feathered favourites, the wild birds, in
these hard times? Fertile as they are in resources, and indefatigable
in providing for the wants of the passing hour, all their little shifts
must frequently prove inadequate to the supply of their daily wants in
such trying times as these. St. Valentine&rsquo;s day has come and
gone, but neither in copse, nor hedgerow, nor ivy-mantled wall, find we
as yet any traces of nidification, nor has the love-prompted warble, in
past years so loud and incessant at this season, been yet heard around
us. The robin only cheeps; the sparrow simply chirps; the linnet merely
twitters; and even the &ldquo;gay chaffinch&rdquo; can only give us a
disconsolate &ldquo;fink, fink,&rdquo; in place of his well-known glad
burst of choicest and cheeriest song. The mellow chaunt of the merle
and song-thrush delights not yet the ear from copse or brake at early
morn or evening-tide. The intense and piercing cold, which, on the
wings of the northern blast, sweeps over the land as we write, and as
it moans, and sighs, and wildly shrieks by starts in its progress over
the deep, causes the lone sea-bird to utter its eeriest and wildest
cry, has succeeded in freezing, not only the rivulet and the pool, but
has actually bound up the voice of gladness and every source of joyful
utterance in all our feathered friends as well. But &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">nil desperandum</i>,&rdquo; better times are coming. Fields will
yet be green, trees will yet be leafy, rivers unbound from icy fetters
will yet dance merrily in the sun, and laugh with all their ripples, as
they hasten seawards; and then &ldquo;again shall flowers appear on the
earth; the time of the singing of birds shall have come, and the voice
of the turtle be heard in our land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are glanders incurable? is a very ugly, but doubtless a very
important question, which is being at present keenly discussed in the
columns of several metropolitan journals. By <i>glanders</i> is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>meant, not the equine disease in the equine
subject properly so called, and which comes so frequently under the
treatment of the veterinary surgeon, but the same frightful disease
when introduced either by accident or design into the <i>human
system</i>. Is <i>it</i> curable? This is the question, and the general
impression seems to be, that when it once fairly lays hold of the human
system, it is, like hydrophobia, quite and utterly incurable. We do not
pretend to know anything of the subject, and we allude to it merely to
say that we well recollect of hearing, on undoubted authority, of a
patient who was actually cured of glanders, caught, if we remember
rightly, from eating some beans found in a manger in which a horse
having the disease had recently been feeding. All the circumstances
connected with the case and cure were related in our hearing by the
late Dr. John Reid, Professor of Anatomy in the University of St.
Andrews, one evening that we dined at his house during our attendance
at the University. It is now some eighteen or twenty years ago, and we
were then too young and thoughtless to give that attention to the
subject which it deserved. We recollect, however, that the case was
said to have occurred in Edinburgh, and to have been treated in the
infirmary of that city, and that the patient, on his recovery, having
been found shrewd, intelligent, and steady, was afterwards appointed
one of the janitors of that institution. There must be some medical
gentleman still in Edinburgh able to speak to a case of such
importance; and amongst others present on the occasion that we heard
Professor Reid refer to it, were, if we rightly remember, Principal Sir
David Brewster and Professor Martin, now of Aberdeen, and at that time
Mathematical Master in the Madras College of St. Andrews.</p>
<p>The other evening a one pound note, which a lady friend of ours had
just received by post, was handed to us, with a request that we should
try and decipher some writing which was observed on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>the back
of it. After some little trouble, we were a good deal amused to find
that the writing in question really consisted of the following
lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I am a note of the British Linen;</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;ve long been kept by L. Mackinnon;</p>
<p class="line">Where&rsquo;er you go you&rsquo;ll find them
willing</p>
<p class="line">To give for me just twenty shilling.&mdash;L.
M&rsquo;K.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">We have no idea who this poetical L. Mackinnon is or
was, but it is pretty evident, we think, that both he and the British
Linen Company&rsquo;s Bank note had very excellent opinions of
themselves. It was Lady Louisa Stewart, if we rightly recollect, who
sent Sir Walter Scott a copy of the following lines, which she
discovered on the back of a battered bank note which had come into her
possession. It will be observed that they are in all respects
immeasurably superior to Mr. L. Mackinnon&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Farewell, my note, and wheresoe&rsquo;er ye
wend,</p>
<p class="line">Shun gaudy scenes, and be the poor man&rsquo;s

<p class="line">You&rsquo;ve left a poor one; go to one as poor,</p>
<p class="line">And drive despair and hunger from his door.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="first">One swallow doesn&rsquo;t make a summer, says the
proverb, and unless one fine day (the 19th) makes a spring, we
haven&rsquo;t for the last six weeks [February 1870] and more had a
single hour of a character to be disassociated from one of the wettest
and wildest winters on record. No sooner has one storm died away, less
from any voluntary cessation on its part than from sheer exhaustion of
its forces, than, after a slushy, sludgy interregnum of brief duration,
it has been succeeded in every instance by another and another still of
equal or greater violence and fury, so that of quiet or calm we have
known little, and of sun or moon or stars we have seen hardly the
briefest glimpse since Old New Year&rsquo;s Day. When Foote, the
incomparable comedian (Johnson said of him that &ldquo;the dog was
irresistible&rdquo;), after acquiring and dissipating several fortunes,
was at last lucky enough to be able to set up his carriage in a more
dashing style than ever, he selected as his motto, and emblematical of
his career, the words <i lang="la">Iterum, Iterum, Iterumque</i>!
(Again, and Again, and Again!) It has struck us that if the
Meteorological Society were to apply to the Herald&rsquo;s College for
a crest and armorial bearings to be displayed on the title-page of
their volume of &ldquo;Transactions&rdquo; for the first quarter of the
current year, we, should they do us the honour to consult us, would
suggest a cloud-cumulus, rain-surcharged, proper on the shield, with
Aquarius and the &ldquo;watery&rdquo; Hyades as supporters; Eolus
ordering &ldquo;a fresh hand to the bellows&rdquo; as a crest, and the
<i lang="la">Iterum, Iterum, Iterumque</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>of
Foote&rsquo;s chariot as a motto of singular appropriateness and
meaning. How delighted, by the way, must our amphibious friend Mr.
Symons be in the midst of all this rainfall! <i>His</i> crest again
should be a man&rsquo;s head on a fish&rsquo;s body in an overflowed
meadow, <i>natant</i>, and his supporters an <i>anemometer</i> and
<i>rain-gauge</i> proper! It is needless to say that anything like
spring work is with us not only in a very backward state, but has
hardly been commenced. Before the end of February we had our own corn
seed and potatoes in the ground last year. If we get them down this
year any time during the next month, it will be earlier than the
weather at the date of the present writing promises. Our ornithological
studies extend over a greater number of years than we care at this
moment very accurately to count; but never have we known our wild-birds
so listless and loveless on Shrovetide Eve as they are this season.
Except an occasional carol from the wren, who has a soul as big as that
of his namesake Sir Christopher, who built the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s
(the wren also, by the way, is a dome-builder), and an irregular
strophe at rare intervals from the redbreast, our woods are songless,
and of nidification there is not a sign. <i lang="la">Meliora
sper&#257;re</i>, nevertheless, is sound philosophy. Let us hope for
better things: He is faithful that promised that <i>while the earth
remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and day and night, shall not cease</i>. Scott has few finer
passages than the following, which we are fond of repeating in such a
season as this. It occurs in his epistle to William Stewart Rose,
introductory to the first canto of <i>Marmion</i>, and, though very
beautiful, is seldom quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">On her rich roll of worthies, Scotland has but few
names of whom she has more reason to be proud than that of Walter
Scott. If we had even said <i>not one</i>, an objector might perhaps
find the assertion more difficult to disprove than he wots of. Nor has
the star of his marvellous power and influence for good set or been
extinguished; it has only been clouded for a season by the intervention
of exhalations of the &ldquo;earth, earthy&rdquo;&mdash;exhalations
that the growth of a healthier and holier taste is already dissipating,
and the Wizard&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>star shall reappear in undiminished lustre,
and young and old will clap their hands and rejoice in its purity and
power. Some years ago arose a school of poetry that flared and
flickered for a season, and found admirers on the same mysterious
principle, we suppose, that Antoinetta Bourignon and Joanna Southcott
found followers. It was happily styled the &ldquo;spasmodic&rdquo;
school; and it died and disappeared&mdash;the best thing it could do. A
new school has succeeded, that may be called the sensuous, and, we had
almost said, the lascivious, and with a strong tendency to the
reproduction in modern guise of all that was worst and best in the
ancient Greek drama. Of this school, Mr. Swinburne is, <i lang=
"la">facile princeps</i>, the chief. It also will last but for a
season, and will die and disappear ignominiously, as did its
predecessor. There is yet another school, that has existed for some

<i>goodyism</i>&mdash;&ldquo;too good for banning, too bad for a
blessing.&rdquo; <i>It</i> also is slowly dwindling, and dwining, and
dying, and must soon expire, leaving people hardly any better or worse
than it found them. And so with the novels of the day, with their

horrors, worse than were mingled in the bubbling cauldron of the
witches in <i>Macbeth</i>: <i>their</i> day is doomed; for purer taste,
banished but for a moment, must reappear&mdash;is already
reappearing&mdash;and people, awakening as if from a dream, will once
again consent to quench their thirst at healthier fountains, and to
wander in less questionable bye-paths. The poetry and novels of Scott
will then resume their attraction and reassert their influence and
power; and whithersoever <i>he</i> leads, no parent need be ashamed to
follow, or feel obliged in the interests of morality to forbid and
forego the companionship of wife or children through scenes where there
is everything to delight and nothing to offend. It is well that in the
world of poetry and fiction, as in social and political affairs, the
maxim holds true that&mdash;</p>

<p>Of Mr. Gladstone, the politician, there are many more enthusiastic
admirers than ourselves, though we would not willingly be supposed to
yield to any one in our ardent admiration of his ripe scholarship and
unrivalled eloquence; but we shall think better of him while we live,
and have a kindlier and warmer interest in all he says and does, on
account of his recent eulogium on the character and writings of Sir
Walter Scott.</p>
<p>And who can speak of Scott, or think of Abbotsford and Melrose and
the classic Tweed at the present moment, without also thinking of
Allerly and Sir David Brewster, one of the greatest men of science that
Scotland has ever produced; and greater far, as sometimes happens in
such cases, <i>out</i> of it than <i>in</i> it, for during full forty
years, wherever, throughout the habitable parts of the earth, science
had lit her lamp and could count her votaries, however humble,
<i>there</i> the name of David Brewster was familiar as a household
word, and his discoveries known and applauded. He was the first really
distinguished man of letters and science we ever knew, and it was while
writing one of the earlier chapters of this work, on a subject in which
he felt the keenest interest, and in connection with which we had
occasion to mention his name, that the grand old man, venerable in
honours and in years, was breathing his last, with a Christian
resignation to the Divine will, and a Christian&rsquo;s joyful faith in
the Divine mercy and goodness. Passing through the valley of death, he
feared no evil, for his Lord and Saviour sustained his steps. Through
the first Lady Brewster (<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e2268" title=
"Source: n&egrave;e">n&eacute;e</span></i> Macpherson), to whom we had
the honour of being known before we had yet seen her distinguished
husband, we were fortunate enough to be admitted, at the very beginning
of our curriculum at college, to a degree of familiarity with the
Principal of our University, that our relative positions would not
otherwise have warranted, and which we have the satisfaction to
remember we had sense enough to value highly and to be proud of even at
that early age. It was by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>practised hand that the instrument
was adjusted through which we had our first view of two of the most
beautiful sights that the telescope reveals to us&mdash;Jupiter with
his belts and retinue of attendant moons, and Saturn with his rings;
and very patient and good-natured and kindly were his replies to our
eager questionings with regard to the nature of the wonders then first
opened to our gaze. Sir David, if forced into it, could fight, and
never turned his back on an assailant. If you hit him, he hit again,
and he always hit severely; but he was, notwithstanding, a man of
kindest heart and most amiable disposition, and it would be difficult
to meet with any one more cheerful or courteous or pleasant within the
circle of his own family and in his daily intercourse with his
acquaintances and friends. <i lang="la">Requiescat in pace</i>: he was
in truth a great man. Not often does it happen that in the same
country, and within so short a time of each other, two such stars so
large and lustrous as Faraday and Brewster have disappeared from the
firmament of science. A century may elapse ere the thrones they have
left vacant shall again be adequately filled. There is something
extremely beautiful and affecting in one of Sir David Brewster&rsquo;s
last utterances upon earth. On the morning of his death, Sir James
Simpson, standing by his bedside, remarked that it had been given to
him to show forth much of God&rsquo;s great and marvellous works; and
the dying philosopher solemnly and quietly replied, &ldquo;Yes, I have
found them to be great and marvellous, and I have found and felt them
to be <i>His</i>.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=

Fecundity&mdash;Large Specimen of the <i lang="la">Raia

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For several years past [March 1870] the spring fishing
with &ldquo;long lines&rdquo; in our western lochs has been so
unsuccessful as to be hardly worth the while engaging in it. At our
very doors, where with the hand-line during the summer and autumn
months, some ten or twelve years ago, we could almost always depend on
a large basketful of the finest rock cod, gurnard, haddock, and
flounder, as the result of a couple of hours fishing, more recently
very few, and sometimes none at all, could be caught, with the
cunningest exercise of all the patience and piscatorial skill at our
command, while in winter and spring the long-line fishing of grey cod,
skate, and ling, and eel has been equally disappointing. Why it should
be so no one would venture to say; the utmost you could get out of the
oldest fisherman on the coast was an admission of the fact, with a
shake of the head and a shrug of the shoulders, that if so disposed you
could very readily interpret into the line, albeit unknown to him,
that&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas true &rsquo;twas pity, pity
&rsquo;twas &rsquo;twas true,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">a cautious reticence on the point that was altogether
praiseworthy, for really and truly nobody did know or could say
anything satisfactory in explanation of the mystery. Was it owing to
the multiplication of the number of steamers, screw and paddle,
constantly coming and going, and like Tennyson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;years&rdquo; at their unamiable meeting, &ldquo;roaring and
blowing,&rdquo; keeping the waters in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>perpetual turmoil, and
scaring the fish from their usual haunts? Such an hypothesis could be
seriously entertained for a moment only to be rejected. Could it be
owing to any cyclical meteorological changes, or to anything anomalous
in the order of the seasons? Admitting that something of this kind has
been going on for some time, and is still going on, it was readily
seen, nevertheless, that it was all too inappreciable and remote to
have had the result complained of&mdash;to cause that in the waters of
&ldquo;the great deep&rdquo; which it had failed to effect in any
noticeable way on the dry land. Or, was it that the fish themselves, by
reason of their numberless enemies, afloat and ashore, were actually
diminishing in numbers, and so necessarily becoming scarcer from year
to year? No one, however, knowing anything of the economy of the fish
in question, could for a moment entertain such an idea. The fecundity
of these fish is something incredible. We once had the roe of a female
cod, that weighed (the fish) six lbs., first boiled hard, and then
divided with tolerable exactness into so many ounces, and counting the
number of eggs in one ounce, and multiplying by the number of ounces in
the entire roe, we found, at a rough calculation, that in that single
fish, of no great size, there were upwards of <i>a million and a
half</i> of eggs&mdash;each egg destined to become a fish, and, barring
accidents, to attain to the average age and size of its kind. But
however we may try to account for the scarcity of these fish in our
lochs for several years back, it is an agreeable duty to have to record
that during the past winter and spring there has been a marked
improvement alike in the quantity and quality of the fish caught all
along the western seaboard. Not only have the common fish of our own
coasts been taken in considerable numbers, but several kinds of fish
formerly known only as occasional visitors to our shores have this
season been plentiful in all our lochs, and have well repaid the
diligence of their captors. The long-nosed skate, for example, formerly
a rare fish with us, has this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>season been common. It is known to
ichthyologists as the <i lang="la">Raia chagrinea</i>, and is not only
excellent eating, but from its enormous liver supplies a large quantity
of very fine oil, that burns with a clearer and steadier light than
that of any other fish with which we are acquainted. We are convinced,
by the way, that, used medicinally, it would be found equally
efficacious with cod liver oil in all cases where the latter is
recommended, whilst its rather agreeable taste and flavour would render
it a tolerably palatable dose in its purest and strongest state, which
cod oil never becomes, manufacture, and decoct, and clarify it as you
may. A very fine specimen of the <i lang="la">Chagrinea</i> was caught
here about ten days ago. It was cut up and disembowelled before we saw
it, but we should guess that its weight when taken off the hook could
not have been less than 70 lbs. All the skates are ugly brutes, and the
long-nosed <i lang="la">Chagrinea</i> is at once perhaps the ugliest
and the best of its tribe. Some people don&rsquo;t eat skate, nor can
we say that we are partial to it ourselves, though we once heard a
noted <i>gourmand</i> declare that the &ldquo;wing of a skate was equal
to a shoulder of a salmon.&rdquo; We should, for our own part, rather
have the salmon. While in Oban about a month ago, an extremely
fierce-looking and ugly fish, the name and character whereof not a
little puzzled its captors, was brought for our inspection. Luckily for
our credit as a naturalist, we had previously seen more than one
specimen of the same fish with the St. Andrews fishermen, it being by
no means a rare visitor to the eastern and north-eastern shores of
Scotland. It was the wolf or cat-fish, closely related to the family of
the Gobies (<i lang="la">Gobioid&aelig;</i>), the <i lang=
"la">Anarrhicas lupus</i> of ichthyologists. The head of this curious
and most repulsive-looking fish has some peculiar markings, which, with
the fierce glaring eyes and their position in the face, and the
formidable array of long, sharp-pointed, recurved teeth, give it much
of the expression of an enraged cat, and hence doubtless its common
name. For the same reasons, and on account <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>probably
of its character as a fierce, relentless tyrant among more amiable and
less powerful fish, it is known among the Channel Islands and along the
coasts of England as the <i>wolf</i>-fish. The only fish at all
approaching it in ugliness and repulsiveness of features is the
better-known angler or fishing-frog (<i lang="la">Lophius
piscatorius</i>), which also, by the way, is not so common of late
years on our western coasts as it used to be. <span class=

<p class="first">With the exception of a slight drizzle on Saturday the
last ten days have been wonderfully fine for the season [February
1870]. Seldom, indeed, have we been so near realising the
&ldquo;ethereal mildness&rdquo; of Thomson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Spring&rdquo;
so early in the year. And, in sooth, it was high time that some such
pleasant change in the weather should take place, for no living wight

the storm of the previous six weeks.</p>

than to snow-balling; but really for the six weeks above specified
nothing less than the direst necessity could tempt one to any other
pastime than the prudential and prosaic one recommended in the couplet.
Grant him but license to grumble, however, and man can endure, and that
scathlessly, much more than he wots of. And how easily is he after all
restored to equanimity and even cheerfulness! Here we are already,
placid and pleased, enjoying the fine weather; the cold and the wet and
the boisterous gales of January and December altogether forgotten, or,
if remembered, remembered only to give zest to the bright and sunshiny
present. And never, we believe, were song-birds in such free and full
song on St. Valentine&rsquo;s day. Morning and evening (the interval,
you must know, dear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"

and nest-building), from copse and woodland, ring out the richest

pluck and pre-eminence as a songster, term the <i>kingbird</i>), and a
score of other &ldquo;musical celebrities,&rdquo; vie with each other
in the richness and the melody of their incomparable song. Within a
month, should the weather continue favourable as at present, most of
our wild-birds will have finished their nests, and commenced the
labours of incubation. We trust that our readers will do all they can
this season to prevent children and <i>others</i> from what is called
&ldquo;birds&rsquo;-nesting,&rdquo; one of the most cruel pastimes to
which any one could turn himself. All good men, and most great ones,
have been remarkable for their attachment to animals, both domesticated
and wild, and particularly to song-birds. Listen to Virgil&rsquo;s

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The light which led astray</p>
<p class="line">Was light from heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">We were much amused the other day at seeing a heron, a
long-necked, long-legged bird, doubtless familiar to the reader, for
once in a &ldquo;fix.&rdquo; We say &ldquo;for once,&rdquo; for it is a
most sagacious bird and thoroughly master of its own particular
<i>r&ocirc;le</i>, which, it is needless to say, is principally
fish-catching. We were amusing ourselves on the sea-shore during
low-water, watching the habits of periwinkles, hermit-crabs, star-fish,
&amp;c., when we observed a heron at some hundred yards distance,
leaping about, wriggling its body, and performing other strange and
unheron-like antics, as if it had suddenly gone mad. Knowing the staid
and sober habits of the bird in general, we at once came to the
conclusion that something extraordinary &ldquo;was up,&rdquo; and
determined, if possible, to discover what it was. Making a slight
<i>d&eacute;tour</i> to avoid alarming him&mdash;for it was a
<i>he</i>, a very handsome, full-crested male&mdash;we easily managed
to creep within fifty yards or so of him, and the cause of his
excitement and unwonted posturings became at once apparent. He had
caught an eel (a great dainty with the heron family) of about two feet
in length, and of girth like a stout walking-stick, notwithstanding
which, however, Mr. Heron would soon have satisfactorily dined upon it,
had he not made a slight mistake in the mode of striking his prey. The
eel was held in the heron&rsquo;s bill at a point only some three or
four inches from the extremity of its tail, the greater part of its
body and its head being thus left at liberty to twist, and wriggle, and
wallop about <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>. To swallow the eel in this
position the heron knew was impossible, and to let it go, even for an
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>instant, for the purpose of getting a better
&ldquo;grip&rdquo; of his slippery customer was altogether out of the
question. The heron was standing on the very margin of the sea, into
which the eel, if for a moment at liberty, would have shot like an
arrow. It was too large to be tossed into the air and recaught in its
descent, as herons frequently do with other fish; and in short the
heron was at his wit&rsquo;s end, and wist not what to say or do. To
make matters worse, the eel was wriggling and twisting about its
captor&rsquo;s legs, <i>breechless and exposed legs</i> be it observed,
and might, for all we or the heron knew, take one of them at any time
between its teeth, and sharp and cruel, as probably the heron knew, are
an eel&rsquo;s teeth when any part of an enemy has the misfortune to
get between them. Apprehensive, doubtless, of some such danger, the
heron danced and shuffled about, lifting now one leg and now another,
as if he had been practising a new and somewhat complicated hornpipe.
He would at one time leap a foot or two to one side, and immediately
after spring into the air as many inches, attempting the while to
strike his prey against the stones, but always failing in doing this
effectually, owing to want of sufficient &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; and the
insecurity of his hold. Having watched this novel combat for some time,
we made a rush to the scene of action, hoping to succeed in surprising,
perhaps, both the spoiler and his prey. We were disappointed. The heron
instantly took wing, carrying the eel for some instance in his
sharp-edged and powerful bill, but finally dropping it into the sea,
doubtless confessing to himself, as he indignantly winged his flight to
another fishing ground, that once in his life at least he had caught a
Tartar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=

<p class="first">Though by no means everything that we could wish it,
the weather of the last fortnight [July 1870] was a decided improvement
on that of the preceding, and people have managed to get their hay
secured in tolerably good condition after all. No appearance of the
much-dreaded potato blight as yet; pity that it should show its
unwished-for face this year at all, for a finer crop never lay ripening
in the ground. Something has been done in herring fishing, and there is
some prospect of our having enough for local consumption at all events,
and perhaps a little over, which is no small matter in those dear
times. Other kinds of fish are plentiful, and, with sufficient leisure
for the pastime, there is hardly anything of the kind more enjoyable in
fine weather than an afternoon&rsquo;s or early morning&rsquo;s fishing
with rod or hand-line. You never, besides, see the country so well as
on these occasions, or so thoroughly understand the full force of the
poet&rsquo;s beautiful line, that in such scenes</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis distance lends enchantment to the

</div>
<p class="first">Any number of trout, too&mdash;few of them, however,
of any size&mdash;may be caught at present in our inland lochs and
mountain streams, and a dish of these speckled beauties, fresh from the
basket, is a very good thing indeed, though the grilse and salmon eater
may turn up his nose in contempt and derision of such &ldquo;small
deer.&rdquo; Let him; we shall be always prepared to take over
<i>his</i> share along with our own! A curious request was made to us a
short time ago by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"
name="pb59">59</a>]</span>well-known book &ldquo;deliverer,&rdquo; who
frequently passes this way, one of the keenest and most successful
fishers on lake or river we ever knew, and a very quiet decent man to
boot. &ldquo;Will you allow me, sir, to put down some worms in your
place?&rdquo; &ldquo;To put down what?&rdquo; we exclaimed in surprise.
&ldquo;Worms, sir, brindled worms for fishing with, when the rivers are
swollen after heavy rains.&rdquo; We begged to have a look at the
worms, and they proved to be a variety of the common earthworm that we
had never seen before, the difference consisting in their being rather
smaller in size than the common earthworm, and prettily speckled and
streaked all over their length, whence, doubtless, their name of
<i>brindled</i> worms. A lot had been sent to him from Alyth, in
Perthshire, very cunningly done up in a bunch of damp moss; and, having
a few left over after a week&rsquo;s most successful fishing, he wished
to deposit them in this, a central part of his peregrinations, that
they might multiply and be recoverable at any time he wanted them.
Holding one by the middle, between index finger and thumb, in a manner
that would have delighted the heart of old Izaak Walton, the worm
wriggling and twisting the while with all the liveliness of an eel in
similar circumstances, &ldquo;There, sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking
at the lively &ldquo;brindled&rdquo; as if he loved it, &ldquo;there,
sir, is a bonny ane! no troot that ever swam could resist having a dash
at <i>that</i> in a brown and swollen stream.&rdquo; In answer to our
questions, he told us that the brindled colour of the worm had, he
thought, a good deal to do with the trout&rsquo;s liking for it, but,
in his opinion, the brisk and lively motions of the worm upon the hook
was the main attraction. The thing was so manifestly <i>alive</i> and
active, and likely to escape, if not caught at once, that the trout
made a rush at it, with his eyes shut, so to speak, and only discovered
how thoroughly he had been done, when, hooked and landed, he lay
flopping helplessly about on the green grass by the burn side. Getting
piscator a spade, he searched about for a suitable spot, and buried his
worms beneath <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>the turf as tenderly as if he were laying babies
asleep in their cradles. &ldquo;There now, sir,&rdquo; he remarked, as
he finished his colonising, &ldquo;they will breed fast, and soon be
plentiful enough hereabouts, and they will destroy the common earthworm
till not one can be found.&rdquo; So that you see we had an interesting
lesson on bait angling and the natural history of earthworms very
unexpectedly from a very unexpected quarter. We still watch with
interest if the assertion turns out to be true, that the brindled worm
exterminates the common earthworm, notwithstanding their close
relationship. Such a thing we know is quite possible, a notable case in
point being the extermination of the old well-known black rat by the
more modern coloniser, the brown.</p>
<p>The amount of <i lang="la">viva voc&ecirc;</i> information that one
can pick up, not by going actually to look for it, but in the most
casual and incidental manner, from all sorts of people with whom one
may be brought in contact, is simply extraordinary. Some, to be sure,
will have nothing to tell; they are as Dead Sea fruit, full of mere
ashes, that never had sap or substance for good to themselves or
anybody else. Others, again, may know much, but they are cautious and
reserved, and never venture beyond the most superficial and commonplace
<i>chit-chat</i>; but the great mass of people, if you approach them
courteously and frankly, will be found communicative enough, and if you
go deftly about it, you seldom work long in such mines without bringing
some ore to the surface. A day or two ago, for instance, we were
sitting on a rock by the roadside on the opposite shore of Appin,
having rowed ashore from our fishing ground to have a smoke and a drink
of sparkling water from one of the many rivulets that, like so many
silver threads in some rich embroidery, twist and twine with a glad
music of their own adown the green slopes of Benavere. An old man
passing along the way, with a bundle of rushes under his arm, saluted
us with the quiet and undemonstrative courtesy so characteristic of his
class all over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>the Highlands. We invited him to sit down beside
us, and at once he sat down and entered into conversation with us about
the weather, crops, fishing, and other such obvious matters as are
seldom overlooked during the first five minutes of a roadside crack at
this season. By-and-by we asked him about the bundle of rushes. There
were too few of them to be of any use as thatch, and we observed that
they were not of the kind generally used in basket-making&mdash;a
common amusement for the idle hours of shepherds, herdboys, and others
in the past generation, who made very pretty rush baskets for carrying
eggs, butter, and other such light goods to the nearest shop, and
bringing back the tea, sugar, &amp;c., usually taken in exchange. What
were his rushes for then? He gathered them, he told us, from time to
time, always selecting the largest and best, for the sake of their
<i>pith</i>, which served as wick for his lamp; and he showed us the
process of extracting the pith on the spot. He first split the rush
longitudinally, by running his thumb-nail along its length, and then
pressing his thumb transversely against the pith, he ran it along until
the whole beautifully soft and white substance was gathered into a
bundle free of its skin, the pith still remaining unbroken by the
deftness of the process, and easily extended at will to its original
length. This pith is inserted in the same manner as wick in the lamp,
and answers its purpose admirably. We recollect seeing the thing
before, but it is many years since, and we had thought that cotton had
everywhere, even in the remotest parts of the Highlands, long since
superseded the primitive rush pith as wick for lamps. &ldquo;All the
people about me,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;now use paraffin lamps
and cotton wicks, but although perhaps I could afford these as well as
they can, I prefer the good old rush-light of my boyhood. I
remember,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;when all the people in our hamlet
gave a day&rsquo;s work to the tenant of the adjoining farm for leave
to gather rushes for their lamps in the proper season. Fish oil of our
own manufacture <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>was always used, and you will perhaps be surprised
to hear, sir, that the lamp was often a &ldquo;<i>buckie
shell</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;A buckie shell!&rdquo; we exclaimed,
&ldquo;how did you manage to fix it properly? You probably glued its
keel to a piece of wood or something of that kind?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,
sir,&rdquo; was the response, &ldquo;we did not fix it at all. It was
suspended from a <i>cromag</i> or hook of wood or iron projecting from
the wall near the fire-place by a string, one end of which was firmly
tied round the hollow dividing the whorl at the smaller end of the
shell, and the other round the furrow at its larger circumference near
the lip. The loop of the string was then thrown over the hook, and thus
suspended, the shell was filled with oil and a rush pith inserted as
wick, and it made a very good lamp indeed, at once economical and
serviceable. I recollect,&rdquo; said the old man with a smile,
&ldquo;that my father, God rest him! who was a very economical man, and
hated everything like extravagance or waste, allowed us just a shellful
of oil for the winter&rsquo;s night. When that much was spent, we had
to tell our tales, sing our songs, and go on with the work we might
have in hand by such light as was afforded by the blazing peat-fire, or
let it alone till the next evening, just as we pleased.&rdquo; Our
friend concluded by declaring in very emphatic phrase that &ldquo;the
people now are less industrious than they were then; have more money in
their hands, but use it less wisely; are less truthful, less honest,
less to be depended upon in every way than were the people of his
boyhood and their immediate predecessors.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Laudator temporis acti</i>,&rdquo; but there is some truth in it.
You should have heard how grandly and with what an air of dignity the
old fellow spoke that concluding sentence in the most beautiful and
rhythmical Gaelic. The <i>buckie</i> shell referred to above is the
<i lang="la">Buccinum undatum</i>, or common <i>whelk</i>, constantly
to be met with on almost every shore. It is to be understood, we
suppose, that the larger specimens only would be used as lamps in the
manner described by our venerable friend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of British quadrupeds&mdash;perhaps of all existing
quadrupeds&mdash;the pluckiest, and, according to its size and weight,
by far the strongest, is the common weasel (<i lang="la">Mustela
vulgaris</i>). The other day a man in our neighbourhood brought us a
common brown hare, large and in excellent condition, that had been
hunted and killed by a weasel in a very extraordinary manner. In the
evening the man was going up a green glade on the wooded hill-side in
search of his cows, when he heard what he took to be the screaming of a
child on the other side of a small hazel copse which he was passing at
the moment. Supposing it to be a child searching for cows like himself,
that had fallen and hurt itself, or that had perhaps been attacked by
some stirk or quey, angry at being disturbed in a favourite bit of
grazing ground, he ran forward, and hearing the screaming repeated, was
astonished to find that it proceeded from a hare that toilsomely and
with staggering steps was struggling up the steep. On closer
inspection, about which there was no difficulty, for by this time the
poor hare was, in race-course phrase, about &ldquo;pumped out,&rdquo;
and could barely stagger along, he was more than astonished to observe
that a weasel was extended <i>couchant</i> along the hare&rsquo;s back,
with his muzzle deeply sunk into the vertebr&aelig; of his
victim&rsquo;s neck, a position from which no exertion on the
hare&rsquo;s part could possibly dislodge him. Picking up a stone, the
man rushed forward and threw it with all his might, not so much at the
hare as at its lithe and blood-thirsty rider. The hare, however, was
hit, and fell, and with a gasp or two was dead; less from the blow than
from the terrible injuries inflicted by the weasel&rsquo;s teeth, from
which, under any circumstances, it was impossible that the poor animal
could have recovered. Before the man and a dog which accompanied him
could get at the wary weasel, it had with proverbial agility made good
its escape. On examining the hare, we found that it was in truth
dreadfully wounded, the ruthless <i>Mustela</i> having manifestly gone
to work in a very scientific manner, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>the little red-eyed
wretch&rsquo;s motto being &ldquo;Thorough!&rdquo; Once fairly on the
back of his victim, he anchored himself firmly by his teeth right in
the centre of the nape of the neck, just where the head is articulated
to the cervical vertebr&aelig;; and as no exertion of the hare could
shake him off, he leisurely dug down, drinking the blood and eating as
he dug, until the poor hare, faint and exhausted, could only stagger
about in response to each cruel dig of the dental spurs of its terrible
rider. That a creature so diminutive&mdash;weighing only about as many
ounces as a hare weighs pounds&mdash;should be able thus to mount and
master an animal so much bigger than itself, seems extraordinary, and
is only to be accounted for by a lithe agility in the assailant, to be
met with in no other creature perhaps, coupled with indomitable courage
and instinctive blood-thirstiness. We recollect some years ago that an
old man, a James Cameron, belonging to Achintore, near Fort-William,
was savagely assaulted by a colony of weasels, and very severely
wounded before he could get rid of his assailants. He was employed by a
neighbour to remove a cairn of small stones from a grass field, in
which it had long been an eyesore, from the centre of which cairn, when
he had wheeled away several barrows-full, six or seven weasels rushed
out and attacked him. So sudden and unexpected was the attack, that
before he could do anything to defend himself, his hands and chin and
cheeks&mdash;for they instinctively flew at his throat, which was
luckily guarded by the thick folds of a homespun cravat&mdash;were
severely bitten. One or two he killed by taking them in his hands,
dashing them to the ground, and trampling them under his feet; but the
others stuck to him with the pertinacity and viciousness of angry bees,
and it was only by running into a house that was at hand, for aid and
protection, that they ceased their attack and left him. Happening to be
in Fort-William that day, we recollect examining the man&rsquo;s
wounds, and getting the story of the weasel assault from his own lips.
We remember remarking how astonishingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>deep and formidable were
the wounds, to be made by the comparatively small teeth, short though
sharp, of the weasel; and what was worse, they festered again and
again, and gave the man much pain and trouble ere they fully healed up
and disappeared. An old gamekeeper tells us that he once saw a fallow
deer fawn, upwards of six weeks old, killed by a weasel in one of the
Callart parks precisely as this hare was killed, and a fawn at that age
will weigh three times as much as a brown hare in ordinary condition.
In common with most people, we have rather a dislike to the weasel,
though one cannot but view with respect the courage and pluck that
carry him safely through such exploits as these. <span class=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have just had a week of the finest weather
imaginable, dry, bright and breezy, and with uninterrupted sunshine.
The greater part of our hay crop has, in consequence, been secured in
splendid condition, without a drop of rain, in fact&mdash;a piece of
rare good fortune in Lochaber. We do not know if the extraordinary
aspect of the sun at its rising and setting on Monday, the 13th instant
[June 1870], was noticed elsewhere by any of our readers. On the
morning of the day in question it presented a strangely mottled,
yellowish copper-coloured disc, so singularly unusual as to induce an
old seaman, nearly eighty years of age, in our neighbourhood, to call
our attention to the circumstance. In the evening a little before its
setting, it assumed a lurid blood-red colour, which was very
remarkable, and forcibly reminded us at the moment of Scott&rsquo;s
lines in <i>Rokeby</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;No pale gradations quench his ray,</p>
<p class="line">No twilight dews his wrath allay;</p>
<p class="line">With disc like battle-target red,</p>
<p class="line">He rushes to his burning bed,</p>
<p class="line">Dyes the wide wave with bloody light,</p>
<p class="line">Then sinks at once&mdash;and all is night.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">We were unanimous in predicting an immediate and
violent storm of wind and rain, but the next morning came in bright,
breezy, and cloudless, and such it has continued ever since. Such
phenomena, and the nature of the weather following them, are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>always worth recording. Virgil, in his first
<i>Georgic</i> instructs the husbandman to confide in those indications
of the weather afforded by the aspect of the sun, for the rather
curious reason, however, that the obscuration of the solar orb gave
faithful warning of the impending fate of C&aelig;sar! A very striking
instance of a form of sophism, well known to the logician, in which an
accidental circumstance is assumed as sufficient to establish efficient
connection. On the morning of Wednesday last we had a smart touch of
frost here in exposed situations&mdash;a strange and anomalous
phenomenon in the dog-days truly! But when we remember that Mr.
Glaisher (who <i>for purely scientific purposes</i> has put his life
into greater peril than any other living man), in his recent aerial
ascent met with a regular snow-storm at the elevation of only about one
mile above the earth&rsquo;s surface, we shall not wonder so much,
perhaps, that a frost current should, under certain circumstances,
occasionally penetrate earthwards even in the dog-days. We should have
stated above that on the 13th we carefully examined the solar disc with
an excellent four-feet telescope belonging to Ardgour, when it
presented only two &ldquo;spots&rdquo; or <i lang=
"la">macul&aelig;</i>, and neither of these of remarkable size or form,
situated close together on the orb&rsquo;s south-western limb.</p>
<p>We <span class="corr" id="xd26e2556" title=
"Source: are are">are</span> glad to observe that the
&ldquo;Demoiselle&rdquo; or Numidian crane recently shot at Deerness
has been preserved, and is to fall into careful keeping. Its feeding on
oats, however, is very extraordinary, and only to be accounted for by
the supposition that its natural food was so scarce, in a locality so
unlike its own sunny clime, that it was fain to fill its crop with the
readiest possible edible that presented itself. The <i>snowy owl</i>, a
specimen of which is stated to have been recently shot in Sutherland,
is by no means a rare visitor in Britain. A pair, male and female, in
full plumage, were shot on the links of St. Andrews, by Captain
Dempster, of the Indian Army, in the winter of 1847, and are now, we
believe, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>to be seen in the University museum of that city.
They have been known to breed in Shetland, but never, so far as we are
aware, on the mainland, or anywhere, indeed, farther south than 59&deg;
or 60&deg; of latitude. Is the specimen in Mr. M&rsquo;Leay&rsquo;s
possession male or female? What is the colour of its plumage&mdash;pure
white, or slightly barred and mottled with brown? These are important
questions, and every account of such rare visitors should be as minute
in such particulars as possible. The snowy owl, like the Arctic fox,
hare, ermine, &amp;c, <span class="corr" id="xd26e2564" title=
"Source: his">is</span> supposed to <span class="corr" id="xd26e2567"
title="Source: cange">change</span> its plumage with the season, the
immaculate white of its winter dress being exchanged for a summer garb
of mixed, spotted, and barred brown and white. It is highly important
that such a point as this should be decided. The scientific name given
it&mdash;<i lang="la">Surna nyctea</i>&mdash;is incorrect. It is
probably a misprint for <i lang="la">Strix nyctea</i>, so styled by
Linn&aelig;us, and after him continued as most appropriate by
succeeding naturalists without exception. In Sweden, where it breeds
and is very common, it is said to feed principally upon hares, hence
Buffon calls it <i lang="fr">La Chouette Harfang</i>, the latter word
being the Swedish for the white or Alpine hare. It was the French
naturalists, also, who first gave the name <i lang="fr">Demoiselle</i>
to the Numidian crane, its symmetry of form, tasteful disposition of
plumage, and elegance of deportment, in their opinion, fully justifying
the complimentary appellation. Its economy was first carefully studied,
and a correct description of it given, about the beginning of the
present century by the naturalists who accompanied the French
expedition to Egypt under Napoleon, who, whatever his faults were, was
at least neither indifferent to, nor neglectful of, the interests of
the arts and sciences. Does the <i>fieldfare</i> breed in Scotland? We
are afraid the reply must still be in the negative. We have little
doubt that the bird seen by Mr. Fraser of Hamilton was the
missel-thrush, and that the nest and egg in his possession belong to
the same bird, that is, the <i lang="la">Turdus vixivorus</i>, and not
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>its congener the <i lang="la">Turdus pilaris</i>.
We are led to this opinion by the fact that the female missel-thrush is
very like the fieldfare in plumage, and not very noticeably different
in size. The nest referred to by Mr. Fraser was, he says, situated in
the fork of a tree, about fourteen feet from the ground, <i>exactly
about the height the throstle generally fixes upon for its nest</i>,
whereas, according to our best authorities, the fieldfare builds at the
top, or very near &ldquo;the top of the tallest pines.&rdquo; We give
but little weight to the shape and markings of the egg as described,
for it frequently happens that the eggs of different birds, even of the
same species, differ in a very remarkable manner. The hint, however,
that the fieldfare may sometimes breed in Scotland is worth attending
to, and we have marked it down for future inquiry and investigation. It
was for long a question of fierce debate whether or not the well-known
woodcock bred in this country. The matter has, however, been of late
years completely set at rest by the researches of naturalists, clearly
bringing out the fact that it not only breeds in Scotland, but that
such an event, instead of being rare, is, on the contrary, of
comparatively frequent occurrence. This very season, about the middle
of May, one of Ardgour&rsquo;s keepers brought us the wings of a young
woodcock, with the quill feathers still pulpy and soft, which, of the
original bird, was all he could secure from the clutches of a hawk that
was breakfasting on the dainty morsel in the woods of Coirrechadrachan.
We also understand that at least two woodcock&rsquo;s nests, with eggs
in them, were known to some parties in this neighbourhood at the
beginning of the season. It is, therefore, possible that the fieldfare
may yet be proved to breed in Scotland, but the evidence for the
establishment of such a fact must be much stronger than that brought
forward by Mr. Fraser. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If of late we had to admit&mdash;somewhat reluctantly
be it confessed&mdash;that it was &ldquo;wet, <i>very</i> wet,&rdquo;
even for Lochaber, we have it in our power now at length [1st August
1870] to strike a different key-note, and to say that it is dry,
<i>very</i> dry; bright, <i>very</i> bright; hot, <i>very</i>
hot,&mdash;so dry, bright, and hot, in fact, that one might as well be
on the banks of the Nile or Niger as on the shores of Loch Leven, were
it not for a delightful sea breeze that never fails to come to cheer
and gladden us evening and morning; and then you may fancy&mdash;that
is, if you can swim, dear reader&mdash;the unspeakable delight of a
headlong plunge into the cool and sparkling waters of the advancing
tide! The heat is in truth something extraordinary, and if it
weren&rsquo;t that you felt yourself fast retrograding into the same
condition, it would be an amusing study to watch a certain class of
people, generally the most staid and stiff and correct possible, who,
as a rule, would rather die than violate the least of the proprieties,
now going about in a semi-nude state, as if they had just escaped from
a lunatic asylum, panting the while as if they were in the last stage
of asthma, and streaming with perspiration as if they had resolutely
made up their minds to melt away and dissolve like untimely
snowballs.</p>
<p>Crops everywhere are splendid, and, after all the rain of the
earlier part of the season, which gave them <i>growth</i>, this is just
the weather that suits them in their present stage, strengthening and
consolidating their tissues, and bringing them to a rapid and healthy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>maturity. The meadow hay crop is unusually heavy
everywhere. We saw a field belonging to Mr. Maclean of <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2629" title="Source: Argdour">Ardgour</span> in the act
of being cut the other day, and we never saw anything finer or heavier
fall before a scythe. This is precisely the weather for securing such a
heavy swathe in good order, although one cannot but feel for the poor
scythesman, who, brown as an Indian and bathed in sweat, wields his
glittering weapon under a burning, blazing sun, such as at a pinch
might serve the turn of our cousins of Jamaica or Demerara. Some idea
of the extraordinary heat and drought of the past week may be gathered
from the fact that it was frequently found possible to stack or carry
into the barn in one day the hay that had only been cut on the day
previous&mdash;something hitherto unheard-of, we should say, in
Lochaber, or, indeed, in any part of the Highlands.</p>
<p>We cannot recollect having ever before seen all kinds of fungi so
plentiful as they are throughout Lochaber this season. You meet
mushrooms of all sizes and of all shapes, both edible and poisonous;
while fairy rings are so common that you may encounter one or more of
them in every bit of old pasture and in every greenwood glade. One of
these rings we had the curiosity to measure a few days ago, and we
found its diameter to be precisely fifteen feet, giving it a
circumference of upwards of fifty feet, as nearly as possible a a
perfect circle, the emerald outline, studded with its peculiar pretty
white, button-like <i>Agaraci</i>, amid the lighter green of the
surrounding herbage, as distinct and easily traceable, even at several
hundred yards distance, as ever was halo round the moon. We noticed
that a cow, happening to come the way while we were examining another
of these fairy rings, ate them all with evident relish, browsing so
steadily along and around, that when she completed the circle she had
not left a single one. We hope that they agreed with her, though we
should not like to have joined in the repast, for we have a salutary
horror of the whole mushroom tribe. The so-called edible mushroom is
said to be delicious when properly cooked: should it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>ever in
any form be a dish on a table at which we are seated, we promise to
give our share of it, <i lang="la">totus, teres atque rotundus</i>,
whole and unimpaired, to the first that will accept it. To the present
intense heat, coming so suddenly on the back of long-continued rains,
is probably due the extraordinary abundance of all kinds of fungi.</p>
<p>The shoal of whales at present disporting themselves in Lochiel,
intending probably, tourist fashion, to visit Inverness by-and-by,
<i>via</i> the Caledonian Canal, if they can only arrange it with the
authorities, did us the honour to visit Loch Leven, spending an entire
day with us, evidently very much to their own satisfaction, if one
might judge from their lively somersaultings and incessant gambollings.
These whales&mdash;a shoal of some five or six hundred, we should
say&mdash;were a very interesting sight as they gambolled about within
a hundred yards of us, blowing loudly the while and lashing the sea
with foam, until you might have heard the hurly-burly from the top of
the highest mountain in the neighbourhood. They were of all sizes, from
full growth, and old age perhaps, down to veriest babyhood. In the
shoal, two kinds of whale were mingled together in apparent amity and
good-fellowship: the common bottlenose (<i lang="la">Bal&oelig;noptera
acuto-rostrata</i> of La C&egrave;pede&mdash;the highest authority on
cetaceous animals), measuring some twenty or twenty-five feet in
length, and the broad-nosed or rorqual whale (<i lang="la">Bal&oelig;na
musculus</i>, Linn.; <i lang="la">B. rorqual</i>, La C&egrave;pede),
from fifty to sixty feet in length, and appearing beside a bottlenose,
as they came to the surface to breathe, like a Clydesdale horse beside
a Shetland pony. It will be strange if our friends at Fort-William do
not manage to bag some of them ere they repass the narrows at Corran
Ferry.</p>
<p>The heat is oppressive within doors; but Loch Leven, we observe, is
darkening under a rippling breeze from the south-east, and we are off
for a sail in our tidy, little craft, that, with lugsail sheeted home,
will go to windward of anything of equal size on the coast.

<p class="first">However unproductive the herring fishing season may be
<i lang="la">quoad</i> herrings, and this has so far been the worst of
a series of bad seasons [September 1870], it rarely fails to provide
more or less grist for our mill in the shape of some rarity in marine
life worth chronicling. A very ugly and repulsive-looking fish,
extremely rare too, was sent us recently for identification. It was
caught in Sallachan Bay, in our neighbourhood, having become entangled
in the corner of a drift net which the fishermen were hauling into
their boat in the grey morning, after a long, wearisome, and profitless
night&rsquo;s labours. We had seen the fish before, though not often,
and had therefore no hesitation in recognising it as the <i lang=
"la">Chim&aelig;ra monstrosa</i>&mdash;a scientific name, by the way in
which its lack of beauty is plainly enough indicated&mdash;a
cartilaginous fish, two feet in length, and of somewhat elongated and
hake-like form. The general colour is a dull leaden white, mottled on
the under parts with small spots of rusty brown. On examining the
contents of the stomach, they were found to consist of some very small
herring fry, along with partly digested fragments of the adult fish,
whence it may be concluded that the <i lang=
"la">Chim&aelig;ra&rsquo;s</i> favourite prey, when they can be had, is
herring; a conclusion at which we might also easily arrive from the
fact that it is seldom or never met with on our shores, except when
herring are more or less plentiful. At one time the <i lang=
"la">Chim&aelig;ra</i> must have been a less <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>rare
fish than it is now, for it has a Gaelic name, &ldquo;<i lang=
"gd">Buachaille-an-Sgadain</i>,&rdquo; the Herring Herd or Herdsman. It
was probably comparatively common in the good old times, when even our
more inland western lochs swarmed annually with herring shoals, and so
large was the capture, that the salt to cure them, on which there was a
considerable duty at the time, was frequently retailed over a
vessel&rsquo;s side at a shilling the lippy. The late Colonel Maclean
of Ardgour, who attained a great age, with intellect clear and
unimpaired, and who was most particular and exact in all his
statistics, has repeatedly assured us that, in his younger days, say a
hundred years ago, <i>fifty thousand pounds</i> worth of herring used
to be captured annually in Lochiel alone. We don&rsquo;t suppose that
for many years past herring to the value of a tenth of that sum have
been caught in all the lochs between the Mull of Cantyre and the Point
of Ardnamurchan.</p>
<p>The reader probably knows what <i>ringworm</i> is&mdash;a fungoid
eruption on the skin, not uncommon in the spring and early summer in
children and young people of plethoric habits. There is a very
wide-spread belief over the West Highlands and in the Hebrides that
ringworm can be readily cured by rubbing it over and around once or
twice with a gold-ring&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s marriage ring, if it can
be had, being always preferred. In our younger days we recollect seeing
the cure applied on more than one occasion, whether with the desired
result, or ineffectually, we do not know&mdash;we probably little
thought in those days of kilts, <i>cammanachd</i>, and barley bannocks,
of inquiring. For many years we had neither seen nor heard anything
either of the disease or of its popular cure, until, by the merest
accident, it came under our notice a few days ago. Riding home one
evening last week, we observed two little girls and a sturdy
long-legged <i>haflin</i> lad sitting patiently in front of a cottage,
the door of which was shut and locked. The youngsters, rather better
dressed than usual, had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>come from a considerable distance,
and we wondered what they could be doing there. On mentioning the
matter next day, we had the story in full as follows:&mdash;The three
were suffering from ringworm. The owner of the cottage has a marriage
ring of wonderful efficacy in curing this epidermic distemper. They had
come from one of the inland glens to be operated upon, but the
possessor of the ring was away in Glasgow, and only returned home by
steamer late that evening. When she did arrive, the young people were
duly manipulated and ring-rubbed <i lang="la">secundum artem</i>; and
in four and twenty hours thereafter we were gravely assured they were
quite healed. Any gold ring is usually employed, but the particular
ring referred to in this case is much sought after on such occasions,
because, as our informant said, it is of &ldquo;guinea gold,&rdquo; by
which we suppose very pure gold, with the least possible alloy, is
meant; and because it is the property of a widow who was married to one
husband more than fifty years. A belief in the virtue of gold rings in
cures of ringworm is, as we have said, very wide-spread and honestly
held by many. Whether, in common phrase, there is &ldquo;anything in
it,&rdquo; or the whole affair is sheer nonsense, we shall not take it
upon us to decide. We merely submit a common and curious article of
popular belief for the consideration of our grave and learned
dermatologists and the faculty at large. One thing is
certain,&mdash;the owner of the marvellous ring makes no vulgar profit
by her frequent use of it in such cases. She is in comfortable
circumstances, and the whole affair, as far as she is concerned, is a
mere labour of love.</p>
<p>Another popular cure, which for the first time came under our notice
recently, and which in many cases is really efficacious, as we have
heard averred by those who have been benefited by its use, is the
application of a poultice of <i>cold tea leaves</i> to an inflamed or
blood-shot eye. A handful of the leaves is taken from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>the pot,
and placed between two folds of thin cotton or muslin, and applied to
the eye at bed-time, kept in its place, of course, by a handkerchief or
other band tied round the head. In cases of weak or inflamed eyes from
any cause, this is reckoned, in this and the surrounding districts,
&ldquo;the sovereignest thing on earth.&rdquo; And one can quite
understand how tea leaves, at once cooling and astringent, employed in
this way, may benefit a hot and inflamed eye. It is a simple
application at all events, and always at hand; and when more
pretentious remedies are not readily attainable, one would be unwisely
prejudiced, if not actually foolish, to suffer long without giving it a
fair trial.</p>
<p>A less simple and less readily available cure for sore eyes is the

<p class="first">We were recently shown a great curiosity&mdash;a dirk
sheath said to be made of human skin. Its history, as related to us by
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>owner, is as follows:&mdash;In the summer of 1746,
about two months after the battle of Culloden, a detachment of <i lang=
"gd">Saighdearan Dearge</i>, red (coated) soldiers, or Government
troops, was passing through Lochaber and Appin on its way to Inveraray,
the men amusing themselves, and enlivening the tedium of the march, by
burning and plundering as they had opportunity. When passing through
the Strath of Appin, a young woman was observed in a field, busily
engaged in the evening milking her cow. A sergeant or corporal of the
band leaped over the wall into the field, and putting his musket to his
shoulder, shot the cow dead upon the spot; after which gallant exploit
he began the most brutal ill-treatment of the woman. She, however,
defended herself with great courage, and as she retreated towards the
shore, she picked up a stone, which she hurled at her persecutor with
such good aim that it struck him full on the forehead, stretching him
for the moment senseless upon the grass. She then fled towards a boat
that was afloat on the beach, and leaping in, rapidly rowed towards
<i lang="gd">Eilean-bhaile-na-gobhar</i>, an island at a considerable
distance from the mainland, where she was safe from further annoyance.
The tradition is so minute and precise that the heroine&rsquo;s name is
given as <i lang="gd">Silas-Nic-Cholla</i>, or Julia MacColl; and our
informant declared himself to be her great-grandson. The sergeant,
stunned and bleeding, was picked up by his comrades, and carried to the
place of halt for the night, near <i lang="gd">Tigh-an Ribbi</i>,
where, before morning, he died of his wound. His body was buried in the
old churchyard of Airds, but was not allowed to rest there. On the
disappearance of the soldiers from the district, the body was exhumed
by the people, and cast into the sea; not, however, before a brother of
<i lang="gd">Silas-Nic-Cholla</i> flayed the right arm from the
shoulder to the elbow, and of the skin thus flayed was made a dirk
sheath, and this sheath we saw and handled with no little curiosity a
week or two ago. The sheath is of a dark brown colour, limp and soft,
with no ornament <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>except a small virle of brass at the point, and a
thin edging of the same metal round the orifice, on which is inscribed
the date &ldquo;1747,&rdquo; and the initials &ldquo;D. M. C.&rdquo;
There is no reason, we suppose, to doubt the genuineness of the
article, though we hardly expected to find human skin&mdash;if it be
human skin&mdash;of such thickness. It may, however, be partly the
result of the tanning process which it probably underwent, and of time.
In connection with this strange relic of a past age may be stated the
extraordinary fact&mdash;incredible, indeed, if it were not thoroughly
authenticated&mdash;that during the horrors of the French Revolution
there was a tannery of human skins for many months in operation at
Meudon. The raw material, so to speak, of this strange manufacture, was
the skins of the scores and hundreds that were daily guillotined. It is
asserted that &ldquo;it made excellent wash-leather.&rdquo;
Montgaillard, a prominent character of the period, who had the
curiosity to visit the works, and saw the tanning process in full
operation, makes the following curious observation:&mdash;&ldquo;The
skin of the men was superior in toughness and quality to shamoy; that
of the women good for almost nothing, so soft in texture, and easily
torn, like rotten linen!&rdquo; We have had some rebellious
revolutions, civil wars, and all the rest of it in Great Britain and
Ireland, with their attendant iniquities, bad enough in all conscience,
but the French may fairly boast of having beat us; a tannery of human
skins is a venture and enterprise that no one has been pushing and
patriotic enough yet to undertake amongst us, even when axe and gallows
wrought their hardest in days happily long since passed away.

<p class="first">The weather [October 1870] with us here on the West
Coast continues wonderfully mild and open for the latter end of
October. Were it not, indeed, for an occasional sprinkling of snow
along the mountain summits of an early morning, and finding as you
wander about the pathways everywhere bestrewn with fallen leaves, we
might find some difficulty in persuading ourselves, in weather so
bright and summer-like, that the season was at all so far advanced as
it really is, that 1870, with its immediate predecessor&mdash;the
<i lang="la">anni mirabiles</i> of the century&mdash;had already so
nearly run its allotted course. A striking proof of the exceptional
mildness of the weather since mid-August is the fact that a young
wood-pigeon or ring-dove (<i lang="la">Columba palumbus</i>), not yet
nearly full fledged, was brought to us a few days ago from a nest in
the woods of Coirrechadrachan. We have kept it with the view of rearing
it as a pet, though the chances are all against us, the produce of such
late incubations having always less robustness and vitality about them
than birds hatched in spring or early summer. There is a little
difficulty, as a rule, in rearing the ring-dove, and getting it to
become even troublesomely tame, until it purrs and
<i>kur-doo&rsquo;s</i> about your feet, and rubs himself against you
with all the familiarity and <i>empressement</i> of a kitten begging
for its morning allowance of milk. It is, however, exceedingly
quarrelsome and pugnacious among other pets, and so jealous of any
attention bestowed on any one but itself, that it will pout and sulk
for half a day if it considers itself injured in this respect; and yet
so little grateful is it for any amount of kindness you may
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>show it, that when full-grown it will take the
first opportunity that offers to escape into its native wild woods,
never more to look near you. One that we reared from the nest several
years ago had one very amusing habit. Every morning after being fed he
would watch the nursery door, which opened off the kitchen, until he
got it ajar, when he would leap upon the dressing-table and spend a
couple of hours in admiring himself in the looking-glass, preening his
feathers and strutting about and <i>kur-dooing</i> to his <i lang=
"la">alter ego</i> with the most beauish, self-satisfied air
imaginable, the poor bird being evidently under the impression that his
own reflection was a Mademoiselle Ring-dove of irresistible
attractions, and whom he persuaded himself he was on these occasions
busily courting in the manner most approved of amongst the most
fashionable circles of ring-dovedom. His death was a singular one. A
large Aylesbury duck, with whom he used to have constant quarrels, he
being invariably in fault and always the aggressor, got a hold of him
one day near her ducking pond, and in a scuffle, which the ring-dove
himself had causelessly provoked, dragged him into the water, and beat
him with her wings until he was, like Ophelia, &ldquo;drown&rsquo;d,
drown&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We never see these very handsome wild birds, or hear their soft
melodious cooing of summer eve from the neighbouring woods, but we
think of Shenstone&rsquo;s beautiful lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">But alas, and woe the while! William Shenstone of the
Leasowes, with his many tuneful contemporaries, are forgotten, or at
least unread, by the present generation, and the poetasters of our day
claim Parnassus, its Castalian spring and Temple of Apollo, for their
own! All we can is that <i lang="la">in r&ecirc; poetica</i> the taste
of an age tolerant of such an usurpation is little to be commended.</p>
<p>A gentleman in the opposite district of Appin sent us a message a
few days ago begging us to go and have a look at what he termed a
<i lang="la">rarissimus piscis</i>, a most rare fish that had been
caught in a scringe net along with a lot of sethe and mackerel. In
complying with such messages we can seldom be charged with
dilatoriness, as most of our friends will bear witness. Nor was it
otherwise in this case; <i lang="gd">Cha be&rsquo;n ruith ach an
le&ugrave;m</i>, as the Highlanders say&mdash;it was not a run but a
rush, with a leap and a bound&mdash;when they would emphatically
characterise a person&rsquo;s conduct in going about anything with
extraordinary alacrity. The fish in question we found to be an old
acquaintance of ours, though so rare on the west coast that we never
saw or heard of it before during a twenty years&rsquo; residence in the
country, and constantly, too, on the out-look for everything in the
shape and semblance of a <i lang="la">rara avis</i>, whether
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>encased in fur, feather, or scales. It was the
gar-fish of British zoologists, known in ichthyological nomenclature as
the <i lang="la">Belone vulgaris</i> of the family <i lang=
"la">Scomberesocid&aelig;</i>, having the body, which is covered with
minute scales, elongated to a degree almost conger-like. It is
frequently captured on the east coast, sometimes intermingling with
mackerel and haddock shoals in considerable numbers. We have seen it in
the Perth, Dundee, and Edinburgh fish markets; never, as we have said,
on the west coast. It is said to be excellent eating when in proper
season, although there is a prejudice against its use amongst the
fishermen themselves; and it is a remarkable fact, by the way, that
some of the finest fish in the sea&mdash;most in esteem, at all events,
with the fish-eating public&mdash;are frequently rejected by their
professional captors for their own eating in favour of what we should
call the coarser and inferior kinds. For a long time we thought this
was entirely a matter of economy, those that brought the largest price
in the market being sold, and the inferior sorts kept for their own
consumption. Subsequently we had abundant opportunities of finding out
that it was far otherwise. An east coast fisherman will give the
preference at any time, for his own eating that is, to a flounder,
however flabby and flaccid, over a whiting or plaice; he will eat the
hake rather than the finest cod or haddock, and considers the wing of a
skate, dried in the smoke until it is of the colour of the darkest
mahogany, with a <i lang="fr">bouquet</i> the very opposite, be sure,
of the ottar of roses, a tit-bit with which, in his estimation, neither
sea-trout, mackerel, nor turbot can for a moment bear comparison.
Fishermen, too, we have observed with some surprise, seldom eat their
fish fresh; they prefer it salted&mdash;salted, moreover, as a rule to
a degree that to other people would render it almost uneatable. For the
prejudice against the gar-fish there is, however, some excuse. In
popular superstition, &ldquo;<i>lang-nebbed</i>&rdquo; things have
always been in bad odour; and the gar-fish&rsquo;s snout is greatly
elongated, so much so that it bears <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83"
href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>no small resemblance to a
curlew&rsquo;s bill, giving it a wicked, vicious look, that its
structure otherwise, however, belies; for it is altogether incapable of
hurting anything bigger than the very small fry and marine insects on
which it feeds. The prejudice against the gar-fish is no doubt to be
accounted for in part by the curious fact that its bones are of a dirty
green colour, strange and perhaps disagreeable to an eye accustomed to
the ivory-like whiteness of the osseous structure of most other fishes
that are brought to table. We have seen specimens of the gar-fish
captured by the St. Andrews fishermen that exceeded three feet in
length: the fish more immediately referred to only measured nineteen
inches. Our friend has since written us a note to say that on being
shown to a gentleman, &ldquo;professing to know something of
ichthyology,&rdquo; he declared it to be a specimen of the pipe-fish,
which is just about as correct as if a man said that a pelican was a
parrot, or a pig was a giraffe.</p>
<p>In one particular, at least, we resemble Dr. Samuel Johnson. We have
never during our whole lifetime once worn a nightcap. &ldquo;I had the
custom by chance,&rdquo; replied the &ldquo;Rambler,&rdquo; with a
growl at Boswell&rsquo;s inquisitiveness on the subject, &ldquo;and
perhaps no man, sir, shall ever know whether it is best to sleep with
or without a nightcap.&rdquo; But if we don&rsquo;t wear a nightcap,
some of our neighbours do, and to one of these useful articles of
nocturnal <i>toilette</i> befell the following adventure a short time
ago. One of our neighbours, a fine old Highlander, still straight as a
pine tree, and strong and stalwart withal, though already past the
grand climacteric, having had occasion to be in the south in the early
summer, bought himself a speck and span new nightcap, which, neatly
folded up along with some braws for the gudewife, formed a parcel of
which, you may be sure, he was exceedingly careful on the return
journey, constantly &ldquo;keeping his eye on it&rdquo; all the way
from the Broomielaw to Ballachulish Pier, and watching over its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>safety as anxiously as if it contained the wealth
of the Rothschilds in Bank of England notes, or the title-deeds of an
earldom. When at last produced at home, and displayed before the
admiring gaze of a select few in every imaginable angle of light, it
was really a very fine nightcap, a sort of ribbed magenta-coloured
&ldquo;Kilmarnock,&rdquo; with a tassel at top, in which were
intermingled all the hues of the rainbow, such a splendid tassel as was
never before seen in Lochaber: Cardinal Antonelli might have been proud
of it as a pendant to his hat. Having at last been sufficiently
admired, the nightcap was duly put to its proper use, and was found to
answer its purpose perfectly; but one night, while yet the gay
Kilmarnock retained almost all its pristine bloom, lo! it was amissing
at bedtime from its usual place of honour on the corner of its
owner&rsquo;s pillow, greatly to his annoyance you may believe, and not
a little to the surprise and consternation of his amiable bedfellow.
Then, and for weeks afterwards, all search for the missing nightcap was
but so much fruitless labour; nothing could be seen or heard of it, and
it was finally agreed on all hands that it must have been stolen by
some person whose honesty became weak as water in view of the
Kilmarnock&rsquo;s rare magenta colour and gay pendulous tassel. And
the nightcap in very truth <i>was</i> stolen, though the thief was
probably actuated less by the brilliancy of its colours than the cozy
feel of its soft and silken texture. Some time in mid-autumn the
mystery was cleared up in this wise. The nightcap owner was one day
engaged in redding up his barn preparatory to the ingathering of his
crops, when a large rat bolted from between his feet, and, scuttling
across the floor, disappeared, rat fashion, in a hole in the divot
wall. A spade was instantly got, and the hole dug about until its
innermost recess was reached, in which was found a gigantic dam rat
with a litter of a dozen or more young ones. These were all of them of
course straightway despatched, and the cozy nest of moss, dried grass,
and nibbled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>straw scattered about, when lo! as its foundation
appeared the long missing <i lang="fr">bonnet de nuit</i>, the
incomparable Kilmarnock, without a rent or tear, and its colours as
bright almost, and its tassel bobbing as coquettishly as when first
displayed on the points of the shopman&rsquo;s distended fingers over
the counter in the Cowcaddens. There was great rejoicing over the
reappearance of the nightcap, which is now again prized as highly and
watched over as carefully as if it were the nightcap of Fortunatus; and
the owner, a wag and humorist in a quiet way, as are most of our old
Highlanders, has composed a song on the subject (<i lang="gd">Oran do
m&rsquo; Churrachd-oidhche</i>), which, after some coaxing, we got him
to repeat to us some days ago. It pleased us immensely, and made us
laugh until our sides were sore. For the benefit of our readers we may
dash off a translation of it some evening or other when we are
&ldquo;i&rsquo; the vein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going to call at Ardgour House one day last week, and taking a short
cut through the woods, we came across the keeper just as he had shot a
roebuck, the largest we think we ever saw, and with the finest head.
The horns were something extraordinary, both as to size and shape, so
much so, indeed, that although we have in our day met with many fine
ones, we never saw anything for a moment to be compared with these. We
have, for instance, a roebuck&rsquo;s head of our own, kindly given us
some years ago by Lochiel, the horns on which are allowed to be
uncommonly good ones; but we find that they are nearly two inches
shorter in the beam, and less by nearly a whole inch in circumference
of root of antler at its junction with the skull than those of the
specimen shot in Ardgour on Tuesday. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">One of Dryden&rsquo;s best poems, and in many respects

after the lapse of two centuries, no one can read unmoved or
undelighted, so beautifully is it written, so masterly is the
versification, and so vividly are its events portrayed. The year
commemorated is 1666, and the &ldquo;wonders&rdquo; that entitled it to
such pre-eminence were the naval war with the Dutch and Danes and the
great fire in London. If 1666, however, was an <i lang="la">annus

more wonderful year still, nay, an <i lang="la">annus

very far indeed&mdash;much farther, if you try it, than at the outset
you might think at all necessary&mdash;before you meet its match. Just
consider, first of all, the great Franco-Prussian war, with its
countless hosts of slain; with its sieges of Strasbourg, Metz, and
Paris, not to mention strongholds of less importance; its capitulation
of Sedan and captive Emperor; the Empire ruined, and a Republic in its

Germans have recrossed the Rhine. Think, again, of the promulgation of
the doctrine of Papal Infallibility, so speedily, and let us say

this very infallible Pope as a temporal Prince, by the <i>Catholic</i>

"#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>we suppose we may regard the matter
as a <i lang="fr">fait accompli</i>, an event so unheard-of and unusual
that we must go back for an exact parallel for more than two hundred
years, when the Duke of York, afterwards James II., &ldquo;a man of
many woes,&rdquo; married the Lady Anne Hyde, daughter of Lord
Chancellor Clarendon, whose history of the Rebellion is one of the most
interesting, and, on account of its inimitable portraiture, one of the
most valuable works of its kind in the English language. If to all this
be added such events as the loss of the &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; built
and armed on a principle, the ultimate adoption or rejection of which
will so materially affect the navy of the future; the revision of the
Authorised Version of the Scriptures; and many other matters, both at
home and abroad, that will readily occur to the reader, this may be
regarded as a very wonderful year indeed. Occupying the centre, as it
were, of all these events, we are too near them at present to appraise
either their magnitude or importance at their legitimate value. Not the
man at the base of a lofty tower, but he who stands at some distance
from it can take its proportions aright, and we may depend upon it that
the reader of the history of our period a hundred years hence will turn
to the page that records the events of 1870 as at once the most
interesting and important in the annals of many centuries. Reverting
for a moment to the <i lang="la">Annus Mirabilis</i> of Dryden, it is
but fair to acknowledge that they seem to have had one wonder to boast
of in 1666 that we cannot claim for 1870, to this date at least; the
wonder in question being two blazing comets in the nocturnal sky.
Describing the English fleet advancing to attack the enemy at night,
the poet, with a boldness of hyperbole for which he is always
remarkable, says&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;To see that fleet upon the ocean move,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Angels drew down the curtains of the
skies;</p>
<p class="line">And Heaven, as if there wanted lights above,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">For tapers, made two glaring comets
rise!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>But if we have no comets to boast of in 1870, let not the reader
forget that the 14th November is nigh at hand, and that he who gets up
betimes on the morning of that day, and watches till the daybreak, will
assuredly witness a sight more startling, and grand and
&ldquo;glaring&rdquo; than Dryden&rsquo;s comets, wonderful and
startling as they doubtless were. We must be permitted one other
extract from this extraordinary poem. It describes the state of the
contending fleets and the feelings of their respective crews on their
withdrawing for a time from an engagement that resulted in something
like what at the present day we should call a drawn battle:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The night comes on, we eager to pursue</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">The combat still, and they ashamed to

<p class="line xd26e978">And doubtful moonlight did our rage
deceive.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In th&rsquo; English fleet each ship resounds

<p class="line xd26e978">And, slumbering, smile at the imagin&rsquo;d

</div>

<p class="first">We do not know whether the reader will agree with us,
but we look upon these verses as wonderfully fine, and upon the
<i lang="la">Annus Mirabilis</i> as, of its class, amongst the finest,
if not the very finest, poem in the language.</p>
<p>Even from a meteorological point of view, this year, in our part of
the country at least, has had not a little of the <i lang=
"la">mirabilis</i> about it. Byron, we know, awoke one morning and
found himself famous, and we awoke one morning last week and found
ourselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>in mid-winter, albeit the previous day had been
mild, and calm, and sunny, and bright as if it were Whitsuntide, rather
than the Eve of St. Luke the Evangelist. Since then we have had
incessant storms, shifting about and sometimes blowing from every point
of the compass within the four-and-twenty hours, with such deluges of
rain as Lochaber alone can supply in season, or sometimes, <i lang=
"fr">entre nous</i>, out of season as well. The mountain summits are,
at the moment we write, covered with a lamb&rsquo;s-wool-like coating
of virgin snow, and the air has become so chill and raw that we were
fain some days ago to don our winter habiliments for the season. We
have no right or reason to complain, however; a finer summer and autumn
were never known in the Highlands, and since winter must come some time
or other, it is better that it should come in season. The fourth week
of October is not a bit too early for snow, and sleet, and storms, so
that when we hear the winds howling over ferry and firth, and the waves
breaking with sullen roar upon the vexed strand, and listen to the
rattle and the dash of rain and sleet upon the window panes, we shall,
first taking care that the shutters are properly closed and the
curtains drawn, just draw our arm-chair a little nearer the fire, which
our &ldquo;lassie,&rdquo; you may be sure, has trimmed betimes, like
Horace&rsquo;s boy, <i>large reponens</i> peats and coals thereon, and
then, with the <i>Courier</i>, <i>Scotsman</i>, or <i>Standard</i> on
our knee, or a stray copy of the <i>Saturday Review</i> or
<i>Spectator</i>, which some distant friend has kindly sent us, or some
fresh volume from Ardgour&rsquo;s library, the worst we shall say will
be in the words of poor old <i>Lear</i>, &ldquo;Blow wind, and crack
your cheeks! rage! blow!&rdquo; blessing God the while that if our lot
be a humbler one, it is also a happier one than the poor old
king&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A good deal has been written about the enormous numbers of killed
and wounded in the present Franco-Prussian war, the fact being
nevertheless, as we learn on competent authority, that notwithstanding
the improvements made of late years in arms of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>precision, there were, considering the numbers
engaged, quite as many men disabled as in the good old days of
&ldquo;Brown Bess&rdquo; in the wars of the first Napoleon and in our
battles in India. Mr. Hill Burton, in one of his recently published
volumes of the <i>History of Scotland</i>, and an admirable and very
impartial history it is, tells us that in the battle of Langside, an
historical combat on the issue of which so much in the after history of
England and Scotland depended, 10,000 men were engaged for
three-quarters of an hour, with a loss to the Queen&rsquo;s party of
300 <i lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, while the victors only lost <i>one
man</i>! A very extraordinary fact certainly; but a more wonderful fact
still, and neither Mr. Burton nor his reviewers seem to be aware of it,
is that of the battle of <i>Tippermuir</i>, fought in 1644, between the
Covenanters and the famous Marquis of Montrose, in which Montrose was
victorious without the loss of a single man on his own side, although
of the Covenanters between four and five hundred were killed in the
battle and pursuit. Another curious thing connected with the battle of
Tippermuir was this: a body of Highlanders, keen enough for the fray,
were without arms of any kind, when Montrose, pointing to the stones
that thickly strewed the field, advised them to try these to begin
with, and they did, appropriating the arms of their enemies as they
fell, and using them with such effect that the battle proper was over
in less than half an hour. The only other battle that we can recollect
in which such primitive weapons as stones were employed by the
combatants was that of <i>Cappel</i>, fought in 1531, between the
Protestants of Zurich and the Catholics of the neighbouring cantons. It
was in this battle that the celebrated reformer Zwingle, or Zwinglius,
met his death. He was first of all knocked down by a stone that,
fiercely hurled, struck him on the head, and then, with the
exclamation, &ldquo;Die, obstinate heretic,&rdquo; the sword of
Fockinger of Unterwalden pierced his throat, and the reformer was no
more. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>The reader has, of course, seen in the papers how beleaguered Paris
keeps up communication with Belgium and the provinces, by means of
balloons and carrier pigeons. Of balloons and ballooning we have no
practical experience; of carrier pigeons we do know something, the bird
being as well-known to us as is a robin redbreast to a gardener. We
kept them for some time, but were obliged to get quit of them on
account of their ineradicable propensity to purloin our
neighbours&rsquo; turnip seed from the drill immediately after being
sown and before they got time to sprout. All pigeons have this habit,
but the carrier worse and more persistently than any other. The speed
and power of wing appertaining to the carrier pigeon is extraordinary,
and if not well attested would be deemed incredible. We remember, for
instance, that at the Christmas of 1845, when a student at the
University of St. Andrews (<i>best</i> as well as <i>oldest</i>
university in Scotland, gainsay it who may!) we spent our holidays at
Kirkmichael, a pleasant little village in the Highlands of Perthshire.
On leaving St. Andrews we took with us a carrier pigeon, a magnificent
bird. On the 1st of January 1846, at the hour of noon precisely, we
gave this bird, with a bit of narrow blue ribbon tied under his wing,
his liberty on the bridge of Kirkmichael. When let out of his basket he
instantly soared up in a sort of spiral flight, ascending and ascending
cork-screw fashion until he seemed to the eye no bigger than a wren,
then straight and swift as an arrow from a bow he urged his flight
southwards, and became lost to view. On returning to St. Andrews, we
found that our bird had reached his dovecot, eagerly watched and waited
for by his owner, as the College bells were chiming one o&rsquo;clock
on the same day, so that it must have done the distance, about
fifty-four miles as the crow flies, in about one hour, or very nearly
at the rate of a mile a minute. Now, it must be remembered that this
was the bird&rsquo;s ordinary flight. He doubtless sought his distant
home in what one might <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92"
name="pb92">92</a>]</span>call a brisk and business-like manner, nor
swerved, we may be sure, an inch from his course, nor loitered by the
way. He was going well&mdash;<i>very</i> well, if you
like&mdash;throughout, but not going his best. The probability is that
under extraordinary pressure, with a falcon in chase, for instance, the
same bird could and would have gone twice as fast, or at a rate of
something more than a hundred miles an hour. If the reader likes to
experiment in this direction, he can easily try it with the common
domestic pigeon, as we have done more than once. Years ago we recollect
a brother of ours taking, at our suggestion, a common black and white
pigeon from the dovecot here to Oban, where, at a preconcerted hour on
a day agreed upon, he set it at liberty. The bird took nearly two hours
to do the distance, some twenty-three or twenty-four miles as the crow
flies; but it probably lingered some time by the way to feed, as,
instead of being well fed, which should always be strictly attended to,
it received no food at all on the morning of its liberation at Oban.
The house-pigeon, however, is useless except for comparatively short
distances, and even then is never to be much depended upon. His extreme
domesticity predisposes him to pay a visit to every dovecot on the
route, and to fraternise with every flock of brother pigeons he may
happen to fall in with. His peculiar mode of flight, besides, and his
extreme timidity, mark him out as an easy and desirable prey for any
keen-eyed hawk or falcon that may be at the moment <i>impransus</i>, as
Johnson in his early days once signed a note in
London&mdash;dinnerless. The common pigeon, too, wings his flight at a
comparatively low altitude, and becomes an easy shot to any one with a
gun ready to hand when it passes by. Not so the true carrier pigeon,
which flies at a great height, far out of range of needle-gun or
artillery&mdash;out of range of human sight, in fact; so that it is
never in danger of being brought to grief, as was poor Gambetta in his
balloon when passing above the Prussian lines the other day. The
velocity with which some birds fly is almost incredible. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>A hungry
falcon, with his blood up and in eager pursuit of his quarry, will fly
at the rate of 150 miles an hour, and keep it up too until his object
is attained; and the tremendous impetus of the bird at such a speed
accounts for the dreadful wounds that a falcon inflicts when it strikes
its prey, sometimes ripping up a grouse, or blackcock, or mallard, from
vent to breastbone, as if it had been done by the keen edge of a
butcher&rsquo;s cleaver. A goshawk (<i lang="la">Falco palumbarius</i>)
belonging to Henry of Navarre&mdash;the Henri Quatre of after
days&mdash;having its royal owner&rsquo;s name engraved on its golden
<i>varvels</i>, made its escape from <span class="corr" id="xd26e3101"
title="Source: Fontainbleau">Fontainebleau</span> in 1574, and was
caught in Malta within four-and-twenty hours afterwards&mdash;a
distance of 1400 miles, or at the rate of sixty miles an hour,
supposing him to have been on the wing the whole time. But a hawk never
flies by night, so that, on a fair computation, the bird&rsquo;s speed
in winging the enormous distance must have been at the rate of at least
100 miles an hour. We have calculated that a snipe, thoroughly alarmed,
and going its best, can fly at the rate of a mile a minute, and there
are other well-known birds equally fleet of wing. Nor must it be
supposed that the velocity of birds is a mere
&ldquo;flash-in-the-pan,&rdquo; so to speak&mdash;a
&ldquo;spurt,&rdquo; as it were&mdash;which could not be kept up. The
long-sustained flights of migratory birds proves the
contrary&mdash;that birds are not only inconceivably fleet, but, to use
a racing term, that they can <i>stay</i> as well. Of our more familiar
birds, we should say that the common wild duck of our meres flies with
greater velocity than any other bird with which the reader is likely to
be well acquainted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94"

<p class="line">The drooping branches sweep the ground,</p>
<p class="line">And, fast in icy fetters bound,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">The streams have ceased to flow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The snow-clad Soracte itself could not wear a colder
or wintrier aspect than does our own Ben Nevis at this moment. We have,
in truth, had a great deal of sleet and snow and rattling hail showers
of late, with bitterly cold winds and frost enough to induce one to don
his warmest habiliments when venturing abroad, and thoroughly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>to appreciate the comforts of a bright and blazing
fire within doors. Winter, in short, has fairly set in; and we must
just battle with its inclemencies as best we may until a more genial
season has come round. And an unusually inclement and severe winter is
this likely to prove. Our lochs and estuaries are swarming with Arctic
sea-fowl, that already venture quite close to the shore, and seek their
food in the most sheltered bays, a sure sign that much cold weather,
with heavy gales from the north and north-west, cannot be far away.
Among these web-footed visitors from the far north we have observed two
that are extremely rare on our part of the west coast, even in the
severest winters. One of these is the ratch or auklet (<i lang=
"la">Alca alle</i>, Linn.), a very pretty little black and white diver,
the smallest bird of the genus with which we are acquainted, a little
more rotund in form and of a robuster frame than the well-known
<i>dipper</i> of our streams, but otherwise very like it. Another is
the gadwall (<i lang="la">Anas strepera</i>), a species of duck very
rare in our north-western waters&mdash;a very pretty little duck, with
a remarkably loud and harsh voice, so loud that on a calm frosty day it
reaches you over a sea surface distance of several miles. We have only
identified the latter at a distance by the aid of a powerful binocular.
It is not a difficult bird to recognise, however, on account of its
distinct markings, and we are as confident that we have repeatedly seen
it during the present month as if we had it in our cabinet. And talking
of birds, what does the reader think the Prussians are up to now?
Annoyed at the ballooning and pigeon-carrying by means of which
beleaguered Paris manages to keep up communication with the outer
world, the Germans are training falcons to be employed in coursing and
capturing such carrier pigeons as may be observed passing over their
outposts and siege works. Such at least is one item in the last batch
of news notes from Versailles. If the Prussians really mean this, all
we can say is that it is &ldquo;a fine idea, but impracticable,&rdquo;
as Hannibal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>said of Maharbal&rsquo;s suggestion to push on to
the capture of the Capitol after the battle of Cann&aelig;. In the
first place it is allowed on all hands that a few months at most,
probably a few weeks, must decide the fate of Paris one way or other,
while a hawk, to be employed as proposed, requires years of carefullest
training ere it can be depended upon as an aerial cruiser in any way
subject to human control, nor, even if it were otherwise, could a
sufficient number of falcons for the purpose be procured in Europe or
elsewhere. Such an attempt at an aerial blockade must prove a failure.
Even from a well-trained hawk, under the most favourable circumstances,
a carrier pigeon ought to be able in nine cases out of ten to make good
its escape by reason of the velocity and altitude of its flight. Depend
upon it that in all time to come ballooning and pigeon carrying will be
employed by a besieged city, as Paris employs them now; and while gas
can be had to inflate a balloon, and a carrier-pigeon is available,
there is nothing that a besieging force can do to prevent the constant
voyaging of such aerial messengers. One result of this war will be that
carrier pigeons will be bred in larger numbers, and more highly valued
than ever&mdash;carrier pigeon dovecots in each city at the public
expense&mdash;while aerial navigation by means of balloons, having lost
much of its terrors, will more and more become a common and every-day
mode of locomotion. There is an &ldquo;Aeronautical Society&rdquo; in
England, which boasts the names of many distinguished men on its roll
of members, but which, nevertheless, couldn&rsquo;t in twenty years
have done so much for aerial navigation as the Franco-Prussian war has
done in little more than a month. Most people, by the way, have been
disgusted with the King of Prussia&rsquo;s repeated appeals for Divine
aid and pretended recognition of Divine guidance, while wading at the
head of his forces knee-deep in a <i lang="la">mare magnum</i> of
bloodshed and carnage from the Rhine to the Seine. One anecdote,
<i lang="la">apropos</i> of a king&rsquo;s pretended piety and close
alliance with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97"
name="pb97">97</a>]</span>Divine powers in all his undertakings, we
have not seen quoted. It is this: some person once calling on John
Forster, took occasion to remark that the Emperor Alexander (of Russia)
was a very pious man. &ldquo;Very pious, indeed,&rdquo; observed
Forster, with tremendous sarcasm, &ldquo;Very pious, indeed; I am
credibly informed that he said grace ere he swallowed
Poland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preparations on a large scale are being made on the Continent and in
America for observing the great solar eclipse of the 22d December, with
a care and precision never known in the examination of a similar
phenomenon. Never before, indeed, could a solar eclipse be observed and
analysed in its every phase as this one will be. Aided by the
spectroscope, polariscope, photometer, and photograph, with the most
powerful telescopes, and meteorological and magnetic instruments of the
utmost delicacy and exactness, it will be strange, indeed, if our
knowledge of the chemistry and constitution of the great central orb is
not very largely increased on this occasion. In our country the eclipse
will be a partial one only. At the moment of maximum obscuration,
supposing the sun to consist of twelve digits, about nine digits, or
three-fourths of the disc, will be occulted. According to Edinburgh
mean time the eclipse will begin at 10 h. 54 m. morning; maximum
observation, 0 h. 8 m. afternoon; and of eclipse, 1 h. 22 m. afternoon.
A glass of very moderate powers is sufficient for observing such
partial eclipses. Partial though this eclipse is, however, no
phenomenon of the kind of equal magnitude will be seen again in our
country till August 1887, when the eclipse will be very nearly, though
not quite, total.</p>
<p>Never, perhaps, has the solar disc been so constantly and so largely
crowded with <i lang="la">macul&aelig;</i>, or &ldquo;spots,&rdquo; as
during the present year. Some of these spots have recently been very
large. On the 9th of the present month, for instance, there was an
immense circular spot as nearly as possible on the centre of the solar
disc, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>like a bull&rsquo;s-eye in a bright target of
living light, which a little before sunset was plainly visible to the
naked eye. It was the evening of the Fort-William market day, and we
drew the attention of several people returning from the fair to the
unusual phenomenon. One jolly old fellow, who had probably been largely
patronising the &ldquo;tents&rdquo; on the market stance throughout the
day, would insist upon it that he saw, not one big spot on the sun, but
two or more&mdash;and perhaps he did. A few days previously a perfect
stream of <i lang="la">macul&aelig;</i> of all sizes might easily be
observed along the solar equator, looking for all the world as if a
flock of ravens were at the moment passing, in struggling order within
the telescope&rsquo;s field of view, between us and the sun. At the
moment we write these lines, there is a very large spot half-way
between the solar centre and its western limb, that towards sunset, if
the sky is clear, might, we think, be discerned by the unaided eye.
Auroral displays, too, still continue to render our nights, though at
present moonless, and frequently cloudy withal, bright and cheerful by
their broad and mysterious effulgence.</p>
<p>The November meteors of the present year seem to have made little or
no display anywhere. Here it was wet and cloudy, so that we could not
have seen them even if the sky was ablaze with them. <span class=

in the world to meet with, whether at home or abroad. There is an old
Gaelic apologue current in Lochaber, which may perhaps have some
bearing on the point:&mdash;&ldquo;It was long, long ago that, in the
grey dawn of an intensely cold January morning, after a wild night of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>drift and snow, the heathcock of Ben Nevis
clapped his wings, and, in a loud, prolonged, interrogative crow,
addressed his first cousin by the father&rsquo;s side, the heathcock of
Ben Cruachan&mdash;&lsquo;How do you feel yourself this morning, dear
heathcock of Cruachan?&rsquo; &lsquo;So, so,&rsquo; with a feeble
attempt at wing-clapping, responded the heathcock of Cruachan;
&lsquo;So, so; miserable enough, believe me, after such a night as last
night was. And if I am thus miserable down here, it only puzzles me to
understand how you can at all endure it, and live up there on Ben
Nevis.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thanks, my dear fellow,&rsquo; with a second
vigorous clapping of his wings, quoth the Ben Nevis bird;
&lsquo;Thanks, my dear fellow, for your kind and cousinly solicitude
for my welfare. Know this, however, that, bad as it doubtless is up
here on Ben Nevis, <i>I am made to it</i>.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; We can
only suppose that our friends in Skye bear this prodigious rainfall
with such philosophic equanimity and impunity because, like the
heathcock of Ben Nevis, they are &ldquo;made to it.&rdquo; The first
time we heard this apologue was many years ago, in the cabin of one of
the Messrs. Hutcheson&rsquo;s steamers. A rubicund visaged
drover&mdash;a fine-looking man, of burly frame and Atlantean
shoulders&mdash;had just swallowed quite half-a-tumblerful of potent
and unadulterated &ldquo;Talisker&rdquo; at a gulp rather than a
draught, when his parish clergyman, who happened to be reclining on a
sofa at the opposite side of the cabin, got up and expostulated with
his parishioner for drinking ardent spirits in such a way as that;
prophesying that unless he stopped it very quickly it would kill him,
and only wondering that it had not killed him long ago. The drover, who
was not aware until then that his minister was on board, and a witness
to his potations, respectfully took off his broad bonnet, and, with a
bow, begged to repeat the apologue, which he did, <i lang="la">ore
rotundo</i>, in the most beautiful Gaelic; the application being so
manifestly apt and pertinent to his particular case that we all burst
out a laughing, the venerable clergyman&mdash;now, alas, no
more!&mdash;enjoying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"
name="pb101">101</a>]</span>it as much as any one that the tables had
been so cleverly turned upon him. Fables apart, however, the fact of
the matter seems to be simply this, that the humidity of the climate
along our western sea-board, and amongst the Hebrides, is in nowise
inimical to robust health or longevity. It is of course disagreeable
enough at times, and frequently a sad drawback on our agricultural
prosperity; but a minute examination of the vital statistics of the
Western Highlands and Islands would probably go far to show that our
superabundance of rain is rather favourable to health and long life
than otherwise. <i lang="gd">Ach bi&rsquo;dh sin mar a chithear da</i>,
a beautiful Gaelic phrase literally. But be that particular matter
<i>as it may seem to it</i>,&mdash;what would most please us at this
moment would be a month or more of the good old-fashioned winters of
our boyhood, when everything was blanketed for weeks together in soft
and virgin snow, and the earth was at times so braced and bound with
frost that under the rapid tread and multitudinous rush of all the
village schoolboys at play, it rang again like a hollow globe of iron!
It is now, alas, dribble and drip, and splash, slop, and slush from
year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>We are indebted to our excellent friend Mr. Snowie, of Inverness,
for a very curious and valuable stag&rsquo;s head, admirably stuffed,
which reached us the other day by steamer. It is a splendid trophy, a
veritable <i lang="gd">Cabar-F&eacute;idh</i>, which the Chief of the
Mackenzies himself, when the clan was at its proudest, might be glad to
have to adorn the entrance-hall of Brahan Castle. The antlers are of
immense girth and spread; one, except for the brow tine, what is called
a <i lang="gd">cabar-slat</i>; the other with two tines, each of them
almost big enough for an antler of itself. We have seen many grand and
curious heads in our day, both <i lang="gd">cabar-slats</i> and
multicornute; but this, which is properly neither the one nor the
other, is, from its size and peculiar style of antlers, a trophy to be
singled out and admired in a collection of the best heads of the
kingdom. It faces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102"
name="pb102">102</a>]</span>us as we write from the opposite wall of
our study, and constantly reminds us of Scott&rsquo;s magnificent
description of the stag that led Fitzjames and his attendants such a
merry dance in the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>. We must be pardoned for
quoting a passage with which every one is familiar:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;As Chief, who hears his warder call,</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;To arms! the foemen storm the wall,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">The antler&rsquo;d monarch of the waste</p>
<p class="line">Sprang from his heathery couch in haste.</p>
<p class="line">But, ere his fleet career he took,</p>
<p class="line"><i>The dew-drops from his flanks he shook;</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Like crested leader proud and high,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Toss&rsquo;d his beam&rsquo;d frontlet to the
sky</i>;</p>
<p class="line">A moment gazed adown the dale,</p>
<p class="line">A moment snuff&rsquo;d the tainted gale,</p>
<p class="line">A moment listened to the cry,</p>
<p class="line">That thicken&rsquo;d as the chase drew nigh;</p>
<p class="line">Then, as the foremost foes appeared,</p>
<p class="line">With one brave bound the copse he clear&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="line">And, stretching forward free and far,</p>
<p class="line">Sought the wild heaths of Uam-Var.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And yet some stupid people will ask if Scott was a
poet! Even Landseer never painted anything finer or truer to the life
than that word-painting of Scott&rsquo;s. Every one admits that Homer
was a poet: well, then, search the <i>Iliad</i>, point out anything
better, or anything, <i lang="fr">entre nous</i>, quite as good, and
when you have found it, please let us know, and we promise to reperuse
the passage, with every attention and care, in the original of Homer
himself, as well as in the translations of Pope, Cowper, and Blackie;
and if you are right and we are wrong, we shall not hesitate to confess
it, and humbly cry <i>peccavi</i>. Meantime we shall continue steadfast
in our belief that Scott <i>is</i> a poet, and not only a poet, but a
poet of the highest order; more &ldquo;Homeric,&rdquo; too, than any
other poet you can name, either of the present or past century; and
that Mr. Gladstone has had the good sense and penetration to discover
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>this, and the courage to avow it, is one, and
not the least, of many things which make us have a liking for that
distinguished statesman and scholar.</p>
<p>A lady, to whom we are indebted for numberless obligations of a like
nature, has sent us a copy of an old Gaelic lullaby or baby-song, the
composition of which must clearly be referred to the days when
cattle-lifting forays and <i>spuilzies</i> of every description were in
high fashion and favour with the gentlemen of the north&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When tooming faulds, or sweeping of a glen,</p>
<p class="line">Had still been held the deed of gallant men.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is in many respects so curious that we venture on a
translation of it. Attached to it is a very pretty air, low and soft
and subdued as a lullaby air should be, though consisting but of a
single part, as was always the case with such compositions, unlike
ordinary songs, which generally had two parts, and admitted of endless
variations, according to the taste and vocal capabilities of the
singer. It is proper to state that our version is not intended to be
sung to the original air, for which the measure we have selected is
unsuitable. Our only object has been to convey to the English reader
the general sense, with something of the spirit and manner, of the
original.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">To the proper understanding of this curious
composition, a few words of comment and elucidation may be necessary.
The lullaby must be understood as sung by a foster-mother to her
foster-son, the Gaelic words from which the exigencies of verse oblige
us to retain in our paraphrase. In lulling her charge to sleep, the
foster-mother fondly anticipates the time when the boy on her knee
shall have become a full-grown and perfect man; her <i>beau-ideal</i>
of a perfect man, observe, being that, like the heroes of ancient song,
he should be brawny limbed, strong of hand, and swift of foot, able and
willing at all risks to seize and appropriate his neighbour&rsquo;s
goods, especially his cattle, whenever necessity&mdash;an empty
larder&mdash;or honour urged him to the adventure. The coolness with
which the old lady commits her foster-son to the immediate care and
guardianship of the heavenly powers, in the self-same breath in which
she hopes and believes that he will, when he becomes a man, prove an
active and expert thief&mdash;a stealer of beeves from the pastures of
neighbouring tribes, in utter defiance of the decalogue&mdash;is
ludicrous in the extreme. To understand it aright, we must recollect
that in former times it was accounted not only lawful but honourable
among hostile tribes to commit depredations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>on
one another; and as hostility among the clans was the rule rather than
the exception, every species of depredation was
practised,&mdash;cattle-lifting raids, however, being accounted the
most honourable of all, and in the conduct of which the best gentlemen
of the clan might without a blush take an active part. The
&ldquo;lowing of kine,&rdquo; <i lang="gd">ge&ugrave;mnaich
bh&agrave;</i>, occurring in this lullaby, was an old toast of the
cattle-lifting times, that the late Dr. Macfarlane of Arrochar told us,
he himself had often heard when a young man at baptismal feasts and
bridals on Loch Lomond side. The secret of it is this: The <i lang=
"gd">ge&ugrave;mnaich</i>, or &ldquo;lowing,&rdquo; implied that the
cattle were strangers to the glen, whilst those that belonged to the
glen itself, and were the <i lang="la">bona fide</i> property of the
clan, if such there were, were quiet and staid and well-behaved, as
decent cattle should be. The cattle &ldquo;stolen or strayed,&rdquo; as
the advertisements have it, &ldquo;lowed,&rdquo; and were troublesome;
while those born and bred in the glen were content to graze in peace,
and to &ldquo;low&rdquo; only when they deemed it absolutely necessary.
&ldquo;The lowing of kine,&rdquo; therefore, was a toast that meant
neither more nor less than success to the cattle-lifting trade! As
ancient Pistol says&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

always indicative of a coming Storm&mdash;<i lang="la">Corvus
Corax</i>&mdash;Wonderful Ravens&mdash;Edgar Allan Poe.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Snow continues to accumulate on the mountain summits
[December 1870], which all around, from Ben Nevis to Ben Cruachan, and
from the peaks of Glen-Arkaig to Benmore in Mull, now present so many
<i>Sierra Nevadas</i>, while you are conscious at last, and to an
extent that admits of no possible mistake on the subject, that the
wind, which, whether it blows adown the glen or across the sea, has a
chill and penetrating edge to it, is neither the breeze of autumn nor
the zephyr of summer, but the breath of winter itself&mdash;the
hoary-headed and icicle-bearded season, that, with all its drawbacks,
has its uses in the general economy as well as its gentler
<i>confr&egrave;res</i> in the annual. With the exception of one or two
pet days, the weather of the past fortnight has been stormy and wild,
with heavy falls of rain on the lowlands, and sleet and snow among the
mountains. In no one season since we first became a student of the
heavens, now more than a quarter of a century ago, have we had so many
splendid exhibitions of <i lang="la">aurora borealis</i> as the last
three weeks have presented us with in a series of <i lang="fr">tableaux
vivants</i>, which, while they charmed and delighted the intelligent
observer, made the vulgar gape in astonishment and alarm. In every
instance these auroral displays have invariably been followed within
twelve hours by heavy gales of wind and much rain, and so constantly
have we noticed this sequence throughout the observations of many
years, that there is perhaps no meteorological prediction <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>on
which we should be disposed to venture with so much confidence and
boldness as that within twelve or fifteen hours of a bright auroral
display there shall be a storm, and that that storm shall be of heavy
rain or sleet, as well as of high wind. We speak principally of the
West Highlands, but we have no doubt that observation would prove the
phenomena to be the same throughout the kingdom. If we were in command
of a ship at sea, we should consider ourselves quite as justified in
making all necessary preparations for a coming storm on the back of a
brilliant aurora, as we should on observing a sudden fall in the
barometer, the only difference being that the &ldquo;merry
dancers&rdquo; give you longer notice of the approaching gale than does
the mercury. The latter exclaims, &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; and if you
don&rsquo;t look out, and that instantly, calling all hands and making
everything snug, you come to grief, while time enough generally elapses
after the auroral warning, to enable you to prepare at leisure for the
coming storm, and, if it catch you napping, the fault is all your own.
The recent auroral displays seem to have been very general over the
whole of Europe, and are said to have been unusually brilliant in
Canada and the Northern States of America. A more than ordinarily
severe and protracted winter may be expected after all these aerial
perturbations, which, when a French <i lang="fr">savant</i> remarked
the other day to a compatriot, &ldquo;<i lang="fr">Tant pis</i>,&rdquo;
replied the chassepot-bearing <i>mobile</i>, with the invariable
shoulder shrug and grin, &ldquo;<i lang="fr">Tant pis pour Messieurs
les Prussiens!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;thinking, no doubt, of the disastrous
retreat from Moscow, and hoping to see it repeated in a different
direction at no distant day. Except the wren and redbreast, whose pluck
is indomitable, and who are never altogether out of voice, our singing
birds are now songless and silent, or if they do utter a note, it is
but a cheep and a chirp, not a song, another sign that our winter is to
be regarded as having fairly set in. We notice, besides, that some of
our winter visitors from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>Arctic seas have made their
appearance along our shores, while we observe that the rook and grey
crow have already begun to frequent the beach at low water in search of
what may be picked up in the way of a meal, a sure sign that they also
look upon it as already come, and that their food in more inland parts
has disappeared until a kindlier season has come round.</p>
<p>A very large raven (<i lang="la">Corvus corax</i>), the biggest
specimen of this bird we have ever seen, was trapped at the head of
Glencreran a few days ago by a bird-catcher that annually pays the West
Highlands a visit at this season. It was a female, as fat and plump as
a Michaelmas goose, and weighed within an ounce or two of four pounds.
The plumage, as might be expected in a bird of such high condition, was
perfect, with the exception of two of the upper alar feathers, which
were perfectly white, an abnormality, however, that only rendered the
specimen all the more interesting. The raven is the craftiest and
shyest of birds, never venturing within shot of fowling-piece or rifle,
and more difficult than any other bird, perhaps, to be outwitted or
circumvented in any way. With all his craft and caution, however, the
raven is, when occasion calls, one of the most courageous and boldest
of birds. At the time of nidification, for instance, the male will
fearlessly attack the largest falcon and drive him from what he
considers his own proper territory, nor will he shun the combat, as we
have often observed, even with the osprey or bald buzzard when they met
in mid-air on their predatory excursions, and a sufficient <i lang=
"la">casus belli</i> has been found or feigned by either belligerent.
We remember seeing an encounter of this kind several years ago, which
continued nearly an hour, and was a very pretty and interesting sight,
the combatants performing the most beautiful aerial evolutions as they
charged, and parried, and soared, and swooped in fierce and determined
conflict. We noticed that the raven frequently uttered his hoarse and
threatening croak, as if to intimidate his opponent, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>while the osprey fought in perfect silence. The
combat finally resulted in a drawn battle, the belligerents separating
as if by mutual consent, and slowly winging their flight in opposite
directions. The probability is that the raven&rsquo;s pugnacity was
excited on this occasion (March 1863) by the osprey&rsquo;s cruising
about, however unwittingly, in the vicinity of the precipice in a cleft
of which the female raven was at the time brooding on her nest. At such
a time the raven will boldly attack the passing eagle, and harass and
annoy it until the eagle, pestered and teased by the assault, rather
than in any way alarmed, with great good nature evacuates the territory
which the raven claims as its own. The raven has from the earliest ages
been accounted a bird of evil omen, and an object of superstitious
dread and awe, and allusions to the bird in this connection are to be
met with in the literature of most countries, the raven being as
cosmopolitan as man himself. Its croak, so disagreeable, and dismal,
and hoarse, and startling; its colour, a funereal black; its habitat,
the lonely and demon-haunted mountain peaks, giddy precipices, and
dreary solitudes; its lamb-slaying and carrion-eating propensities; its
shy and suspicious manner, as if he knew that he had done evil and was
apprehensive of well-merited punishment&mdash;all combine to render him
in the first instance a noticeable and remarkable bird, and one sure to
be selected for frequent reference in the days of bird divination, a
superstition of which traces may probably be found in the early history
of every country, and thus it would readily be raised to the &ldquo;bad
eminence&rdquo; of a bird of evilest omen&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">During his tour in the Highlands with Dr. Johnson,
Boswell writes a highly <span class="corr" id="xd26e3476" title=
"Source: characterestic">characteristic</span> letter to David Garrick,
and, describing their visit to <i>Macbeth&rsquo;s</i> Castle,
says&mdash;&ldquo;The situation of the old castle corresponds exactly
to Shakspeare&rsquo;s description. While we were there to-day, it
happened oddly that a raven perched upon one of the chimney tops and
croaked. Then I, in my turn, repeated &lsquo;The raven himself,&rsquo;
&amp;c.&rdquo; Now, if a raven in truth did so perch, all we can say is
that it was a very curious place for a raven to be, or ravens, within a
hundred years, must have very much changed their habits and nature. The
explanation probably is that it was a <i>tame</i> raven, or a rook
perhaps, or, likeliest of all, that it was a common jackdaw (<i lang=
"la">Corvus monedula</i>), a pert, impudent, and garrulous little
gentleman in black&mdash;no bigger than a dovecot pigeon&mdash;that Mr.
Boswell mistook (<i>proh pudor!</i>) for the grave, stately, and
sagacious raven, who is as much bigger, and weightier, and wiser than
his loquacious cousin the daw, as Samuel Johnson was bigger, and
weightier, and wiser than his travelling companion, James Boswell. It
is curious to meet with the following on the authority of no less
renowned a personage than the valorous and puissant knight Don Quixote
de la Mancha, the flower of chivalry. &ldquo;Have you not read,
sir,&rdquo; proceeds the knight, &ldquo;the annals and histories of
England, wherein are recorded the famous exploits of King Arthur, whom
in our Castilian tongue we perpetually called King Artus, of whom there
exists an ancient tradition, universally received over the whole
kingdom of Great Britain, that he did not die, but that by magic art
<i>he was transformed into a raven</i>, for which reason it cannot be
proved that from that time to this any Englishman hath killed a
raven.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>We have just called the raven our &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; nor are we
at all ashamed so to designate a bird whom we have known long, and
regarding whom, if other people speak nothing but evil, we at least can
speak a great deal that is good. There is a well-known proverb to the
effect that a certain potentate of sable hue is not so black as he is
painted, nor is the raven. First of all, he is an apt scholar, and a
bird generally of much sagacity, of long memory, and ready wit. It is
on record that on one occasion when the Emperor Augustus was returning
victorious from a battlefield, a tame raven that had received his
lesson, and remembered it to the letter, alighted on the
conqueror&rsquo;s chariot, and saluted him in these
words&mdash;<i lang="la">Ave C&aelig;sar, Victor, Imperator</i>! The
Emperor was pleased, as he well might be, and ordered the raven a
handsome pension for life. Bechstein, who probably knew more about the
habits and economy of ravens, especially in their tame state, than any
other ornithologist before his day or since, vouches for the facility
with which they may be taught to speak, and for their sagacity and
docility generally. He tells the following amusing
story:&mdash;&ldquo;A very clever raven was kept at a nobleman&rsquo;s
residence in the district of Mannsfeldt. Among other things he could
say, &lsquo;Well, who are you?&rsquo; very strongly and distinctly. One
day, as he was walking about among the grass in the garden, he observed
a setter dog which remained near him, and kept constantly walking after
him. Not liking to be thus watched and followed, the raven turned
rapidly round and sternly exclaimed, &lsquo;Well, who are you?&rsquo;
The dog was alarmed at this, hung his tail, and ran hastily away, and
not until he had gained a considerable distance did he turn round and
howl.&rdquo; The raven, besides, is a thorough anti-Mormonite, and
wouldn&rsquo;t live in Utah for the world. If he visits the polygamist
colony at all, it is always under protest against the institutions of
that delectable land, and to be ready to pick the bones of the first
many-wived &ldquo;elder&rdquo; he may catch <i lang="la">in articulo
mortis</i>. Rather should the raven <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>be elected to a seat
upon the bench of bishops, for he is ever careful to fulfil the
apostolic injunction to be the husband but of one wife; and until
accident or old age deprives him of her, he is the model and pattern of
faithful and affectionate husbands, never violating his conjugal vows,
not even to the extent of the most innocent of flirtations or the most
Platonic of intimacies with a neighbouring raveness, even though she
should be younger, and sleeker, and glossier than his own. The raven,
in short, when he pairs, which he does at the earliest moment permitted
by the laws of ravendom, pairs for life, and while his first choice is
spared to him he will no more think of paying court to another, be her
charms what they may, than he will of dying of hunger while there is a
bone to pick, a tender lamb, or braxied sheep within a circuit of a
hundred miles of his eyrie, in the most inaccessible cleft of yonder
beetling precipice. We might now say something if we liked of the
raven&rsquo;s <i>usefulness</i> in the general economy as a
hard-working and indefatigable inspector of nuisances, and how putrid
animal matter of every description disappears, as if by magic, wherever
he is known and appreciated; but this is a utilitarian age, and as we
hate utilitarianism, we are content merely to hint that the raven
deserves special regard as a sanitary reformer. We prefer insisting on
the fact that the raven is a gentleman of very ancient descent, being
able, in the clearest manner, to trace his pedigree in unbroken line up
to the days of &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; Noah himself, as Byron
irreverently styles the patriarch. When any one in our day becomes
distinguished and attracts our special regard, we instantly set to work
to trace his descent, and although he himself can hardly tell who was
his grandfather, we are never satisfied until we have, by hook and by
crook, traced his ancestry to the Ragman Roll or the Norman Conquest,
and, having thus ennobled him to our own entire satisfaction, we cease
not to pet and praise him until he is dead, and then the newspapers
swarm with obituary notices of the distinguished <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>man
who has just departed, and a monument, erected by public subscription,
concludes the farce. The raven&rsquo;s ancestor was unquestionably with
Noah in the ark, and although he has incurred some odium in connection
with the assuaging of the waters, we confess we cannot well tell why,
for all that the ancient, and beautiful, and simple narrative says of
him is this: &ldquo;And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and
fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.&rdquo; On the
point of ancestry, in short, there is no bird that has a better right
to hold up his head than the raven. And just consider: wasn&rsquo;t
Dickens&rsquo; stuffed raven &ldquo;Grip&rdquo; sold the other day for
a hundred and twenty guineas! although if his portrait in the
<i>Graphic</i> is to be depended on, he never was a handsome specimen
of the family, or if he was, then the man who stuffed and &ldquo;set
him up&rdquo; should have received a flogging for his pains. Should the
reader wish to know more about our friend <i lang="la">Corvus
corax</i>, we can confidently recommend him to make the acquaintance,
the intimate acquaintance if he can, of &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo; to be
met with in the works of Edgar Allan Poe, the most weird and wonderful
raven that has ever yet appeared in song or story. <span class=

<p class="first">November closed with a week of the most delightful
weather one could wish for at this season [December 1870], cold, but
crisp and clear; nor has December thus far shown any tendency to
exceptional &ldquo;rampaging&rdquo; either, though come it must, if we
are not much mistaken, and in a style we fear that will cause it to be
remembered. Woodcocks, fieldfares, redwing thrushes, snow buntings, and
starlings are at this moment more plentiful than we ever saw them
before; while Arctic sea-fowl in great numbers crowd our creeks and
bays, and immense flocks of <i>grallatores</i>, curlews, gedwits,
purrs, dunlins, and oyster-catchers, may be seen all along our shores
diligently attending the sea margin as the tide recedes, or with weird
and wild scream urging their eccentric flights from an exhausted
sandbank in indefatigable search of &ldquo;fresh fields and pastures
new.&rdquo; Creeping among the rocks on the back of Cuilchenna Point, a
quiet, sequestered shore, seldom visited by anybody but ourselves at
this season, one evening last week, watching a pair of web-feet that we
finally decided to be <i>smews</i>, a species of <i>merganser</i>, we
were unexpectedly treated to an exhibition of aquatic feats that we had
never before seen equalled, and that we thought no animal, biped or
quadruped, could accomplish in an element not properly its own.
Squatted on the beach behind two huge boulders, a narrow opening
between which enabled us to look seawards, and to see without being
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>seen, we were watching the elegant smews as they
preened themselves, floating gracefully the while, without the movement
of a web, on the calm surface of the cold, clear sea, when right before
us, and within less than a dozen fathoms of the shore, a dark object
suddenly dashed to the surface with a flop and a splash, and as
suddenly disappeared. We took it to be a seal in pursuit of some fish,
as is his wont; but on its reappearance a minute or so afterwards, we
were delighted to see that it was not a seal, but a large otter hard at
work in chase of some favourite fish for supper; and small blame to him
for that same, for if one might judge from his exertions in the
pursuit, he was dreadfully hungry and thoroughly in earnest, not yet
having dined, perhaps, nor even broken his fast since the preceding
evening, for your otter (<i lang="la">Lutra vulgaris</i>) is for the
most part an evening and nocturnal feeder. Nothing could exceed the
elegance and ease with which the otter performed the most extraordinary
and complicated evolutions in pursuit of his prey, his long, lithe
body, pliant and supple as an eel&rsquo;s, twisting and twining in
every direction as the fish darted hither and thither, or swept in
rapid circles in its efforts to escape. Its tail, we noticed, seemed to
act not merely as a rudder in aid of its owner&rsquo;s incessant
perisaltations, but to be in constant motion like a propeller, as if to
assist the broad and muscular web feet in every act of natation. For
ten minutes or more, perhaps, did the chase continue, the fish, that
seemed to be either a haddock or sea-trout of some three or four pounds
weight, occasionally leaping bodily out of the water in its efforts to
escape from the unfriendly attentions of its stern pursuer, the said
pursuer, like a staunch hound, doubling as the fish doubled, circling
as it circled, and diving as it dived, with a persistency and
perseverance that it was impossible to elude, until at last, fairly
beaten in his own element, the fish was captured in a pool of shallow
water, whither it had darted in its terror and bewilderment, the otter
instantly pouncing upon it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=
"#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>and seizing it in his mouth, as
you have seen a terrier deal with a rat. At this moment we rushed from
our concealment with a shout, hoping to frighten the otter and get hold
of the fish, but Monsieur Lutra was too quick for us. With the fish in
his mouth he plunged into the sea, and in a second had disappeared
among some boulders that would probably have afforded him a secure
asylum, even if we had a pack of otter hounds to aid in our attempt at
the dislodgment of a gentleman so cunning.</p>
<p>With the common otter of our inland rivers and lakes we have been
more or less familiar since our school-boy days; but we cannot
recollect having ever seen a marine otter until this occasion. Our
naturalists seem to be very generally agreed that the sea otter and
that of our rivers and fresh-water lakes are one and the same
animal,&mdash;an opinion from which we are not at this moment prepared
to dissent, though the animal referred to above seemed to us to be
larger in size, blacker in colour, with more prominent ears, and a
bigger, bushier tail than any specimen, living or dead, that had
hitherto come under our notice. Certain peculiarities, however, of form
and colouring in the individual are frequently attributable to
accidental circumstances. We remember seeing a very fine dog otter many
years ago, that its owner had succeeded in rendering comparatively
tame, and of some use in the capture of fish for its master&rsquo;s
table, as well as for its own sustenance. The animal belonged to the
innkeeper at Bridge of Tilt, in Athole, and was usually kept chained in
an empty stall in the stable. It was very good-natured and docile, and
evinced its satisfaction on being stroked with the hand and patted by a
curious purring, sort of half whine half bark, altogether unlike the
utterance of any other animal with which we are acquainted. We saw it
presented with a dish of milk, which it readily lapped up, using its
tongue by way of spoon, as a dog does under similar circumstances. With
a collar round its neck, to which a long rope <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>was
attached, it was frequently taken to the river, where it never failed
to catch fish, first driving them, after the manner of a collie with a
flock of sheep, into the nearest pool in which there was a considerable
depth of water, when he pounced upon them with the agility of a wild
cat, and seldom failed to secure two or three of the best and biggest
fish in the shoal ere they could manage to escape. We were assured,
however, that the best place to see the otter at work was not the
river, but one of the moorland lochs, in the depths of which he was
perfectly at home. Here he exhibited the most astonishing feats of
agility in pursuit of his prey; his activity and matchless swimming
powers being backed by a pertinacity and cunning that left neither
trout nor pike much chance of escape. Having marked out and selected
the fish to be captured, it was observed that he stuck to it with the
staunchness of a well-trained hound through all its doublings and
windings, as if for the moment the loch contained none but it, until he
had fairly run it down; the capture generally taking place among the
reeds that bordered the margin of the mere, into which the fish always
rushed on becoming sensible that its adversary was not to be eluded in
open water. If left to himself, it was remarked that the otter was
somewhat dainty and fastidious of taste, rarely eating more of a
captured fish than a little at the back of the head and about the
pectoral fins, when, after a short rest, he was ready to start in
pursuit of another. If this be the habit of otters in their wild
state&mdash;as there is reason to believe it is&mdash;one can fancy how
terribly destructive to fish they must be, killing ten times more than
they actually eat, and these, too, the best and biggest fish they can
meet with in their depredations. Even a single pair of otters, with a
family to rear, must be a terrible scourge on any river they may select
to honour with their attentions for a season; nor is the marine otter,
we may be sure&mdash;such as we saw the other day&mdash;less
destructive when he takes up his residence in the vicinity of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>salmon fishings. Whatever the price of salmon in
the market, depend upon it that the otter&rsquo;s larder is always well
supplied.</p>
<p>The semi-domesticated otter above referred to, after leading a not
unuseful life for a year or two under the careful and always kindly
superintendence of its intelligent owner, managed at last somehow to
break its chain and escape, and was never more seen or heard of. The
only other curious thing about this animal that we can recollect was
his deadly aversion to every feathered creature that came near him.
Whether goose or duck, barn-door fowl or pigeon, he seemed to detest
them all, and would readily, and with every sign of anger, kill such as
he could get hold of, not to eat them, observe, for that he was never
known to do, but just because he disliked them. To all other animals he
could be easily reconciled, and was on good and even friendly terms
with all the dogs, cats, and pigs about the place, particularly
manifesting his love for his stable companions, the horses, by whining
in his strange fashion and straining on his chain to the utmost, as if
he would fain welcome them with a caress, when after a day&rsquo;s work
in the fields they returned to the stable of an evening. We are not
aware that, except milk, which it would readily lap and seemed to
enjoy, this otter was ever known to touch anything in the shape of food
except its natural fish diet. In the old <i lang="gd">Sgeulachdan</i>,
or fireside tales of the ancient Highlanders, we frequently meet with
the &ldquo;<i lang="gd">dun</i> otter&rdquo; or <i lang="gd">dobhran
donn</i>, as one of the <i lang="la">dramatis person&aelig;</i>. He is
generally introduced to us under an amiable character, rescuing
neglected merit from obscurity, relieving distressed damsels, or
succouring the widow and orphans with bountiful supplies of silvery
fish from the tarn amongst the mountains, or the eddying pool beneath
the cascade in the glen. The amiable and friendly otter sometimes turns
out to be an enchanted prince, who, timeously released from the spell
that has doomed him to amphibious habits and quadrupedal form,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>assumes his proper shape, and marries the always
virtuous and beautiful, though frequently humble, heroine of the tale.
In the Hebrides to this day the otter is looked upon with some degree
of superstitious reverence, and a bit of otter skin worn by way of
charm is regarded as an antidote against infection in fever and
small-pox, a preservative from death by drowning, and of singular
efficacy in bringing the labours of parturition to a happy issue. A
mole on a person&rsquo;s skin, whatever its place or proportions, is in
the Hebrides never reckoned a deformity. It is regarded rather as a
&ldquo;beauty spot&rdquo; than otherwise, and believed to betoken a
long life and good luck to the fortunate possessor. In the West
Highlands and Hebrides such a mark on the skin is called a <i lang=
"gd">ball-dobhrain</i>, an otter mark or otter spot, and is no more
accounted a blemish or deformity than was the mole on the right lip of
Dulcinea del Toboso by Don Quixote, though it looked &ldquo;like a
whisker, and had seven or eight red hairs in it above a span
long!&rdquo; In some places a piece of otter skin placed on the head
under a woman&rsquo;s coif, and worn inside a man&rsquo;s blue bonnet,
is supposed to relieve the headache and prevent baldness, while gentle
friction along the affected part with the furry side of a bit of otter
skin is esteemed of sovereign efficacy in erysipelas or
&ldquo;rose.&rdquo; The following is a somewhat free rendering from the
Gaelic of a fable occurring in an old <i lang="gd">Sgeulachd</i>, with
which many of our west coast readers at least must be acquainted. The
moral is obvious.</p>

<p class="first">A finer winter [January 1871] never was known all over
the West Highlands and Hebrides. Some tempestuousness is to be looked
for at this season, and some tempestuousness we have had, but of actual
winter rigour and cold we have hardly had a trace. Only twice during
the winter have we had any frost, and even then it was but slight and
of short duration. On several occasions, however, we have had such
terrible rainfalls as are only known perhaps within sight of the
mountain peaks of Jura and Mull and Morven. On the 19th of January, and
again on the 23d, the rainfall within a given time was heavier than
anything known even with us for many years past. In about sixteen hours
on the 19th, 4&middot;19 inches fell, and quite as much, if not more,
on the 23d. Now, does the reader know what an inch of rain means? It
means a gallon of water spread evenly over a surface of something like
two square feet, or, to put it in a more striking and intelligible
form, it means a fall of a <i>hundred tons</i> upon an acre of land; so
that in sixteen hours on the 19th upwards of <i>four hundred</i> tons
of rain fell on every acre of land for miles and miles around us. It
will be confessed that thus the country was for once at least well
soaked and saturated. All our rivers and mountain torrents were, of
course, in full flood, and throughout the night, when it had calmed
down a little, the &ldquo;noise of many waters,&rdquo; as you lay awake
on your pillow and listened, made wild and eerie music enough, to which
the fitting bass was the boom of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122"
href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>the storm-driven rollers as
they broke in sullen thunder along the shore. We had occasion to be
across Corran Ferry on the wettest of these days, bad as it was, and,
in spite of waterproofs and haps of most approved texture and form, we
returned in the evening so soaked and drenched and <i>droukit</i>, to
use an expressive Scotticism, that we might as well have been for half
an hour up to our chin, over head and ears for that matter of it, in
the deepest pool of the Rhi. When changing our clothes in our own room
after getting home, we managed to raise a quiet laugh with ourselves
over it all, by the recollection of the music and words of a favourite
Scotch reel not altogether inapplicable to our then condition. The reel
in question is a well-known one, though we forget at present its proper
distinctive name. It is, we think, one of Neil Gow&rsquo;s. A gudewife,
presumably of Amazonian heart, and also of Amazonian proportions, makes
her husband wince and quail, and conduct himself with becoming
amiability and decorum, as she sings&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">While stripping, it struck us that we were quite as
wet on the occasion in question, as if for our sins we had undergone
all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>&ldquo;dipping&rdquo; threatened by the gudewife
in the old reel; and the idea put us into good humour until tea and
other fireside comforts made us forget all the pelting of the pitiless
storm. How the remainder of winter and early spring may turn out
meteorologically, it is impossible to forecast with any confidence, but
meantime our old people, in their own opinion, at least, weatherwise
and shrewd <i>quoad hoc</i>, are gravely shaking their heads over what
they deem an unusual dearth of frost and snow in mid-winter.</p>
<p>Our West Coast storms, if in one sense sometimes disagreeable
enough, rarely fail, however, to bring us a good thing in the shape of
hundreds of tons of drift-ware, which, gathered and spread on the land,
is found to be a valuable fertiliser. It is a labour, besides, which
falls to be done in a season when there is little else to occupy the
people&rsquo;s time, and saves an immense deal of trouble when the
spring comes round, for the land is ready for the plough and the
immediate reception of the seed, whatever the crop&mdash;thus saving at
once the manure heap for purposes in which farmyard manure is
indispensable, and all the trouble of long cartage afield. In
collecting his share of a huge swathe of this drift-ware the other day,
one of our neighbours found a dead fish, quite fresh and unmutilated,
which being new to him, though a fisherman and sea-shore man all his
life, he thought might be interesting to us. He accordingly brought it
to us, and to us also it was new, and as such, of course, exceedingly
interesting. We puzzled long over it ere we satisfied ourselves that we
had determined its identity. It was a small fish, some six inches in
length, and of smelt-like shape and form and colouring, but it was not
a smelt. After some little trouble, we finally decided that it was a
species of atherine (<i lang="la">Atherina</i>) belonging to the
<i lang="la">Mugilid&aelig;</i> or mullet family. Our particular
specimen was the <i lang="la">Atherina presbyter</i>, a not uncommon
visitor on some of the south of England shores, but so rare in our seas
that, as we have already said, we never saw a specimen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>before. We are told that the atherine is very
good eating, and we can quite believe it, for it is a pretty,
delicate-looking little fish, that, nicely fried until properly crimp
and brown, ought to taste well. A much commoner fish, but interesting
in this instance for the great size of the specimen, was an angler,
fishing-frog, or sea-devil (<i lang="la">Lophius piscatorius</i>),
which was cast ashore near Corran Ferry last week. This was the largest
individual of the species&mdash;the ugliest, perhaps, of all
fishes&mdash;that we ever saw. It measured five feet seven inches from
snout to tip of tail, and weighed fifty-three pounds. It was poor and
fleshless, and had died seemingly of sheer inanition or atrophy; had it
been in full condition, it would have weighed a third more. Its
terrible mouth, with its formidable array of sharp recurved teeth, was
enough to scare a friend that accompanied us to a distance, though we
assured him that the brute was dead and harmless. On opening out its
jaws to a fair extent&mdash;that is, as far as we thought the animal
itself would open them easily if need were, we placed a large turnip
from a pit that was conveniently at hand, a turnip nearly as large as a
man&rsquo;s head, easily within the horrid cavern. We would willingly
have taken this specimen home with us, for the purpose of preserving
the skeleton, but we had no conveyance with us, and any idea of
carrying it was out of the question. It had, besides, evidently lain
some time on the beach, and its odour on moving it in the least was,
the reader may believe, the very antipodes of Eau de Cologne or ottar
of roses. We contented ourselves therefore with slitting open its
stomach with our pocket-knife, and found it, as we expected, perfectly
empty, containing nothing in the shape of food, except the tips of two
claws and small bits of the carapace of a not uncommon species of crab,
the velvet fiddler (<i lang="la">Portunas puber</i>). The Highlanders
of the west coast and Hebrides call the angler <i lang="gd">Mac
L&agrave;mhaich</i>, properly <i lang="gd">Mac
L&agrave;thaich</i>&mdash;the son (that is, <i>inhabitant</i>) of the
mud or ooze; a very expressive and appropriate name for it, for it is
essentially a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span><i>mud</i> fish, in which, half buried and
<i>perdu</i>, it hides and watches, tiger-like, for its prey. The
naturalist meets with many things to puzzle him, and it has always
puzzled us to account for the large size of this animal&rsquo;s head
and mouth, altogether disproportioned to the size of the rest of the
body. No matter how insatiable the cravings of the brute&rsquo;s
maw&mdash;to use a Miltonic word&mdash;no matter how gluttonous soever
of appetite, the head and mouth, and number and size of teeth, do seem
unnecessarily formidable, monstrous indeed, for any conceivable work
that they can be called upon to perform; and yet there is
unquestionably good reason for it all, if we could only find it out. It
may interest some of our readers to know that the sea-devil belongs,
ichthyologically, to the Acanthopterygious family of fishes. <i lang=
"la">Acanthopterygious!</i> what a staggerer to any one except a
learned ichthyologist at a Spelling <i>Bee</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Mortimer Collins and others are recently down, somewhat
hypercritically we can&rsquo;t help thinking, on Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s
occasional natural history references throughout his poems. The fun is
that in almost every instance in which fault is found with him, Mr.
Tennyson is right and his critics wrong! Here is one example of this
hypercriticism in which Mr. Mortimer Collins is fairly hoist with his
own petard. Mr. Tennyson writes&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In spring a fuller crimson comes upon the
robin&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Upon which Mr. Collins comments&mdash;&ldquo;As a
fact, that fuller crimson comes in autumn, as all know who watch the
half-shy, half-familiar bird&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;That ever in the haunch of winter
sings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here Mr. Mortimer Collins is partly right and largely
wrong, while Mr. Tennyson is altogether right. It is true that our
native song-birds, moulting in autumn or early winter, assume at this
season a thicker, warmer, fresher plumage after all the wear and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>tear consequent on the labours of nidification,
incubation, and love-making throughout the spring and summer; but it is
equally true that it is only in spring, as Mr. Tennyson correctly
asserts, that our wild birds assume their gaudiest and gayest attire,
every colour and shade of colour in the individual bird&rsquo;s
feathering there and then only being at its best and brightest. And
when we remember that spring is the season of love and incipient song,
we should be very much surprised, and with good reason, if the fact
were otherwise. So far as our recollection serves us, Mr. Mortimer
Collins, or any one else, will find it rather difficult to catch Mr.
Tennyson tripping in the direction indicated. We should say that the
Poet Laureate was rather remarkable than otherwise for his fidelity to
nature and truth in all his local colouring.</p>
<p>Some time ago, by the way, we had occasion to call attention to the
exceeding frequency of misquotation in our current literature, and in
quarters, too, where one would least expect it. Here is a curious and
very unpardonable instance, all things considered. In a review of the
<i>South Kensington Handbooks</i>, in the <i>Times</i> of the 18th
January, a sentence opens thus&mdash;&ldquo;It is well-known that
<i>weary</i> lies the head that wears a crown<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3782" title="Source: ?">.</span>&rdquo; Every one will see that
the manifest intention here is to quote from the monologue of the poor
harassed and sleepless King in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry IV. (part
second), one of the finest things that even Shakespeare ever wrote, and
we had thought too well-known by every one with any pretensions to
literature to be misquoted. The concluding lines are these:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;st thou, O partial sleep, give thy
repose</p>
<p class="line">To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude;</p>
<p class="line">And in the calmest and most stillest night,</p>
<p class="line">With all appliances and means to boot,</p>
<p class="line">Deny it to a king? Then, happy, low, lie down:</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A brilliant display of aurora borealis on the early
morning of the 8th [February 1871] led us to conclude that a change of
weather was not far distant; and before sunset of that same day the
wind had gone round from east by south to south-west, and a drizzling
rain, with a very much milder temperature than we had known for three
months, told us that, for the present at least, King Frost had agreed
to suspension of hostilities. Since then it has been mostly wet, with
occasional hailstone showers, and turbulent withal, if not actually
stormy. The revictualling of Paris under the terms of the capitulation
and armistice was not a more sensible relief to the starving
inhabitants than was the recent thaw to our wild birds on sea and
shore. The moment they became convinced that it was no sham, but a
real, veritable thaw, they revived amazingly. Shaking off the torpidity
in which cold and want had so pitilessly bound them, they took heart,
and bustled about in search of such food as might now be procured by
diligent seeking in copse and hedgerow, by pool and stream. An
occasional strophe, sadly inconsecutive and discordant, may now again
be heard when the sun shines out and the storm has lulled, from some of
our hardier warblers, and we have observed that in some instances rooks
have begun to pair; but our bird-world, upon the whole, is far from
what it should be at this date; more taken up, like vanquished
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>France, with the thought of the mere necessities
of life and the reestablishment of their exhausted energies, than with
love or music, or the gaiety and <i>abandon</i> so characteristic in
ordinary seasons of our feathered friends on the back of St.
Valentine&rsquo;s Day. The meridian sun, however, is now steadily
climbing zenithwards, and the day perceptibly lengthening apace, so
that our wild birds, rapidly gathering strength, and daily improving in
tone and tune, may, after all, arrive at their day of jollity and
joyousness sooner than we anticipated. We captured a beautiful
<i>Scarlet Emperor</i> butterfly a few days ago, as brisk and lively as
possible, on a window pane in Ardvulin Cottage, Ardgour. How beautiful,
by the way, and how suggestive of spring and vernal delights in a land
of plenitude and peace, is the following from the Song of
Solomon:&mdash;&ldquo;For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and
gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds
is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig-tree
putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes give
a good smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another animal besides the hedgehog has of recent years made its
appearance in Lochaber, though previously unknown, so far as we are
aware, anywhere in the West Highlands. The animal in question is the
water-rat, water-vole, or British beaver. The last is, perhaps, its
most appropriate name, for the animal is neither kith nor kin to the
rat, while very much in its economy and habits, as well as in its
corporeal structure, particularly its dentition, allies it not remotely
to the beaver tribe. In size, the water-vole is more robust in body and
larger in every way than the common rat, with a more silken pile, and a
bigger and brighter eye. It frequents the banks of streams and ponds,
feeding on the more delicate aquatic plants, and on the bark and tender
shoots of the willow, alder, and such other shrubs as love to grow</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The quiet waters by.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>That such an animal inhabited Lochaber was accidentally revealed to
us two years ago, and so unmistakeably that there was no room for doubt
or hesitation in the matter. We were returning from Fort-William on a
beautiful summer afternoon, walking by the hill route through Lundavra,
when having already accomplished more than half the distance at our
best pace, we sat down to rest and solace ourselves with a
pipe&mdash;not the Arcadian musical instrument, observe, but the more
prosaic article anathematised in the royal <i>Counterblast</i>&mdash;by
the side of a canal-like reach in the River Rhi, as it slowly winds
through Glenshelloch, when our attention was drawn to a splash in the
water at a short distance above us, to which, however, we gave but
little heed, taking it for the lively flop of a half-pound trout
engaged in fly-catching for supper. Another and a louder splash,
however, aroused our curiosity, and induced us to creep cautiously in
the direction whence the sound proceeded, and there, sure enough,
disporting themselves round a gnarled alder stump that projected into
the stream from the water-line on the opposite bank, were a pair of
water-voles, full-grown, and brisk and lively as ever we had seen them
in our younger days in the upper reaches of the beautiful Eden in
Fifeshire, a favourite habitat. After watching their gambols for some
time, we threw a pebble into the pool, when they instantly dived and
disappeared, only to emerge in a few seconds near a large boulder
further up the stream, behind which, and cunningly concealed beneath
the overhanging bank, was their hole, into which they popped as readily
as does an alarmed mouse into a wall crevice. As they dived and pursued
their subaqueous flight in the direction of their hole, the eye could
follow their every movement, for the water was as clear as crystal.
Keeping very near the bottom, it seemed as if they progressed partly by
swimming and partly by running along the gravel, at any rate with
amazing celerity and ease. We noticed that about their necks and
shoulders their pile <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130"
name="pb130">130</a>]</span>appeared as if adorned with numberless tiny
pearls&mdash;air bubbles, in fact&mdash;that adhered to their fur, and
that, frequently shifting the position like quicksilver drops, as the
animals moved, had a very pretty effect. Since that time the water-vole
has been repeatedly seen about the lower reaches of the same river,
between the Inchree Falls and the highway. It has also been seen in
some parts of the Blackwater above Kinlochleven. Ardent disciples of
Izaak Walton and others interested in the preservation of trout and
salmon hold the water-vole in great dislike, under the belief that it
feeds largely on fry and ova. The accusation we believe to be
unfounded, as much so as the egg-eating charge against the hedgehog. We
shall not attempt to prove a negative, the <i lang="la">onus
probandi</i> of their averments logically resting with the accusers;
but we will say that we have known the water-vole for many years, and
at one time had every opportunity of studying its habits, and we never
had cause to entertain the slightest suspicion that it was anything
else than a vegetable feeder. We recollect once questioning old John
Robertson of Perth, than whom a better fisher, whether on lake or
stream, never cast a fly or impaled a worm, about the
water-vole&rsquo;s alleged liking for fish-spawn and fry. His reply was
in these words, &ldquo;I dinna believe it, sir; I have fished in maist
feck o&rsquo; the rivers, burns, and lochs in Perth, Fife, and Kinross,
and other counties forbye, and the fish were just as plentiful where
the splash o&rsquo; the <i>gleb</i> (a local name for the water-vole)
was heard a&rsquo;maist at every cast o&rsquo; the line, as where none
could be seen for days together.&rdquo; We know, besides, that the late
Professor John Reid of St. Andrews, one of the most distinguished
comparative anatomists of his day, and who had dissected many of them,
was of opinion that the water-vole was a vegetable feeder and nothing
else, he having never been able to detect anything to lead him to the
conclusion that it fed on fish or their spawn. Suspicion of the
water-vole&rsquo;s being addicted to the malpractices in question was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>first of all grounded on the fact that
fish-bones were frequently found along the banks of the streams he
inhabited, and sometimes about the entrance of, and even in, the hole
which was his habitat and home; and on this evidence alone the
water-vole soon got into very bad repute indeed. As to the finding
occasionally of fish bones along a water-vole inhabited stream,
although the fact is indisputable, it really goes for nothing,
suspicious as it looks, for similar relics of defunct trouts and
troutlets may be seen any day on the margin of streams where a
water-vole was never yet known to exist. The real culprits in such
cases are the otter, the common rat (a great fish-eater in shallow
streams and almost as expert a swimmer as the vole itself, only that it
cannot dive so well), the heron, king-fisher, and grey crow, all of
whom are fond of fish, either as an article of constant diet, or as an
occasional make-shift in default of more legitimate fare. As to the
fish bones to be sometimes met with in the water-vole&rsquo;s holes,
the dusky-coated and white-vested dipper and the beautiful plumaged
king-fisher are alone to blame. The castings, indeed, of a single pair
of king-fishers would of itself suffice to account for all the fish
bones one meets with by the banks of ponds and streams, for the
beautiful <i>Alcedo</i> is a voracious fish-devourer, and his hole
going backwards and upwards some three or four feet into the bank,
invariably a perfect charnel-house of bleached fish bones of minnows
and troutlets. The number of small fish that a pair of king-fishers,
with their young, dispose of in a single season must amount to many
thousands, and as the larger bones at least are always cast or
regurgitated, their presence may always be taken as a sure indication
that the spot has recently been the haunt of the most beautifully
coloured of British birds. When the bones of larger fish, however, are
met with, the blame, if blame there be, must be shifted from the
king-fisher to the shoulders of one or other or all of the animals
above mentioned. It is only fair that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>the spirit of our
laws, which accounts a man innocent until he is proved guilty, should
be extended to beasts and birds as well. In this view of the matter the
water-vole has good reason of complaint that it has been over hastily
and unwarrantably condemned on insufficient evidence, without even the
form of a fair and impartial trial. Unlike Ritson, the antiquary and
balladist, who, although he was a strict vegetarian in diet, holding
all manner of animal food in utter abhorrence, and writing a volume on
the subject, was yet as cross-grained and as irascible as a wasp, the
water-vole, like a true vegetarian, is quiet and unobtrusive even to
timidity, leading an inoffensive life, and in his play hours,
which&mdash;in proof of his good sense, let us remark&mdash;are very
numerous, as frolicsome and sportive as a kitten. He will show fight,
it is true, if attacked in his hole or otherwise brought to bay, and
his bite, whether on the nose of an over-venturesome terrier, or the
hand that would rashly seize him, is very severe and difficult to heal;
but it is only doing him the merest justice that those who know him
should bear witness that in general character and disposition he is the
most peaceable and harmless of animals. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">A fall of snow on Monday, followed by keen frost
during three consecutive nights, rendered the past week [March 1871],
as to mere cold at least, the most wintry of the season; but with a
bright sun circling at mid-March altitude, the frost had no time to

<p>A coin was sent us for identification a few days ago, the history of
which strikes us as interesting. We had no difficulty in determining it
to be a silver Spanish dollar of the time of Philip II. It is much
corroded and worn, but the following letters of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>original inscription are distinctly
legible:&mdash;<span lang="la"><abbr title=
"Philippus II, Dei gratia Hispaniarum et Indiarum rex">Ph. II., D.G.
Hisp: et Ind: Rex.</abbr> 1585</span>. On the reverse disc is what
seems to have been intended for the prow of a ship between two palm
trees. The owner of this coin tells us that it came into his possession
in the following manner:&mdash;A brother of his, who owned and
commanded a coasting schooner about fifty years ago, chancing to be
becalmed while passing through the Sound of Mull, thought it best to
come to anchor for the night. Next morning, when getting under weigh,
the anchor, as it came to the bows, was found to have brought up a
large mass of tangle. While clearing this away, the edge of the coin
was observed sticking out from among a lot of sand and shingle attached
to the tangle roots, and having been secured and handed to the Captain,
he ever after kept it in his purse as a &ldquo;luckpenny,&rdquo; on
which he set a high value, and all the more so, perhaps, that it
happened to be found on the morning of Easter Sunday, a fact that to
him, as a good Catholic, had a significance and meaning that the rest
of the crew took no account of. Be this as it may, he was from that day
an exceedingly prosperous and lucky man in all his undertakings, and
till the day of his death he carried the coin about him wherever he
went, as a &ldquo;luckpenny&rdquo; and talisman of extraordinary
virtue. The present owner, too, sets a very high value on this
numismatic talisman, which, he declares, hardly anything would induce
him to part with. During the ten years that it has been in his
possession, he assures us that he has been prosperous and successful as
he never was before, with never a moment&rsquo;s illness; and although
too sensible and shrewd a man actually to assert that the coin has
anything to do with it, it is a fact that he very seriously looks upon
his Spanish dollar as a sort of &ldquo;lee-penny,&rdquo; giving its
possessor a fair chance of an amount of health and wealth, that without
it he might struggle for in vain. This nonsense apart, however, the
question remains, What business had a Spanish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>dollar in the bottom of the Sound of Mull? How
came it there? Our theory is that the coin originally belonged to some
one connected with the great &ldquo;Invincible Armada&rdquo; of 1588.
It is a well-known historical fact that, after the defeat of the
Armada, the already shattered and discomfited fleet, in attempting to
return to Spain by sailing round Scotland and Ireland, was overtaken by
a dreadful storm, in which many of the ships were wrecked. One ship,
named the &ldquo;Florida,&rdquo; ran for shelter into the Sound of
Mull, and while at anchor off Tobermory harbour, was captured and
destroyed by a body of Mull and Morvern men, under the command of
Maclean of Duart. This fact is sufficiently attested by a remission,
under the Privy Seal, to that chief for his share in the somewhat
questionable transaction, bearing date the 20th March 1589. The
&ldquo;Florida&rdquo; was destroyed by being blown up, with all her
armament and stores, and many of her crew&mdash;a treacherous and cruel
act, for Scotland at least was then at peace with Spain&mdash;and it is
probable that the Spanish dollar so recently examined by us reached the
bottom of the Sound on that occasion, and there remained till fished up
in the curious manner above related, upwards of two centuries
afterwards. Some of the timbers of the submerged &ldquo;Florida&rdquo;
have from time to time been brought to the surface, and a casket formed
out of part of her windlass was presented by Sir Walter Scott to George
IV., during his visit to Scotland in 1822.</p>
<p>An unsuccessful attempt, by means of divers, was made in 1740 to
recover some of a large amount of treasure said to have been sunk in
her; but some very beautiful brass guns were brought up, one of which
is still to be seen at the Castle of Dunstaffnage, near Oban, and
another, we believe, at Inveraray. These were last made to speak loud
and lustily, not against a Queen of England, as was their original
errand to our shores, but in honour of the marriage of the daughter of
a Queen of Great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>Britain with the son of a Scottish Duke,
who now owns the lands which belonged to the Macleans, by whom the
&ldquo;Florida,&rdquo; carrying those very guns, was destroyed. Thus
does &ldquo;the whirligig of time bring about its revenges.&rdquo; Some
years ago we were shown by a gentleman in Glasgow a large ebony-stocked
pistol, beautifully carved and inlaid with mother-of-pearl and silver,
which was said to have been secured from the wreck of the
&ldquo;Florida.&rdquo; We recollect that the corroded state of the
barrel and lock abundantly satisfied us at the time that, whether it
had belonged to the &ldquo;Florida&rdquo; or not, it had at all events
long lain in water, and more probably, from the peculiar form of
corrosion, in salt water than in fresh. As to the dollar, we have only
further to state that its owner now thinks more of it than ever: our
suggestion as to its very probable connection with the Spanish Armada
having largely enhanced its value in his estimation. Its mere intrinsic
value as a bit of silver would, we think, be fully and fairly appraised
at something like twenty pence sterling.</p>
<p>We were the other day accidentally brought into contact with a
curious superstition, which, although not peculiar to this district,
but common, we believe, over all the Highlands, was yet quite new to
us. We were sailing past the beautiful island of St. Mungo, in Loch
Leven, the burial-place for many centuries of the people of Nether
Lochaber and Glencoe, when the following conversation took place
between ourselves and an old man who managed the sails while we
steered. It was all in Gaelic, of course, but we give the substance in
English:&mdash;&ldquo;You were at the funeral on the island the other
day, sir?&rdquo; interrogatively observed our companion. &ldquo;I was,
indeed,&rdquo; we replied. &ldquo;John &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; he
continued, naming the deceased, &ldquo;was a very decent man.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He was a fine old Highlander, shrewd and intelligent,&rdquo; we
replied, &ldquo;and, what is more, I believe a very good man.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Donald &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; naming a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>person we both knew, &ldquo;is very ill, and not
likely to last long.&rdquo; &ldquo;I saw him to-day,&rdquo; we
observed, &ldquo;and I fear that what you say is true: he cannot last
long.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sir, it will be a good thing for John
&mdash;&mdash; (the person recently buried); his term of watching will
be a short one.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not understand what you mean,&rdquo;
we observed, with some curiosity. &ldquo;The man is dead and buried;
what watching should he have to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, sir, don&rsquo;t
you know that the <i>spirit</i> of the last person buried in the island
has to keep watch and ward over the graves till the spirit of the next
person buried takes his place?&rdquo; &ldquo;I really did not know
that,&rdquo; we replied. &ldquo;Is it a common opinion that such is the
case, and do you believe it yourself?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sir, it is
generally believed by the people; and having always heard that it was
so, I cannot well help believing it too. The spirit whose watch it is,
is present there day and night. Some people have seen them: my mother,
God rest her! once pointed out to me, when I was a little boy, an
appearance, as of a flame of light on the island, slowly moving
backwards and forwards, and she assured me it was the watching spirit
going his rounds.&rdquo; &ldquo;What particular object has the spirit
in watching?&rdquo; we asked. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t exactly
know,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;He just takes a sort of general
charge of the Island of the Dead, until his successor arrives.&rdquo;
We have since found that a belief in this superstition is common among
the old people. The spirit or ghost is supposed to be to a certain
extent unhappy, and impatient of relief while in the discharge of this
office, and thus, it is considered, that the sooner after a funeral
there is occasion again for the opening of a grave, the better it is
for the spirit of the last person interred, who then, and not till
then, passes finally and fully to his rest.</p>
<p>We have to warn such of our readers as dwell by the sea, and all
&ldquo;who go down to the sea in ships, and see His wonders in the
deep,&rdquo; that unusually high tides may be expected <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>in
connection with the new moon of the 18th. The highest tide, however, is
not likely to be exactly coincident with the change of the moon, but at
the time of the second or third flood thereafter. Along our Scottish
coasts the tidal wave will probably be highest on the morning of the
20th, so that this notice may yet be sufficiently timeous. Much,
however, will depend on the state of wind and weather, as to the height
the tide may attain at any particular place. In any case, it can do no
harm to be prepared.</p>
<p>To such of our readers as may be engaged in the rearing and tending
of flowers at this season we very willingly communicate a hint that may
be found useful. And it is this. In filling flower-pots or window-sill
boxes, there is frequently considerable difficulty in procuring soil
that will be at once sufficiently rich, free of weed seeds, and finely
pulverised. The despised and sadly persecuted mole provides the very
thing wanted, and in little round heaps, waiting only to be gathered,
commonly called molehills. For flowers, whether in pots or borders,
there is nothing so good as molehill earth. The <i>rationale</i> of the
thing is, as is well-known to every one in the least acquainted with
the natural history of the interesting velvet-coated subterranean
tunnelists, that they live on worms and insect larv&aelig;. These are
always found in the best soil, which is hurled to the surface in round
heaps by the industrious little animal while in pursuit of his prey,
and in so pulverised a state, and so free of weed seeds, as to be above
all others the soil most suitable for all manner of ordinary
floriculture. With such soil we have grown the purest dahlias and
wallflowers we ever saw anywhere. The old Royalist toast, &ldquo;To the
little gentleman in the black velvet coat!&rdquo; was in sly allusion
to the death of a high personage from injuries received by his horse
stumbling over an insignificant molehill, and whose name by the way is
disagreeably connected with a dark deed done heretofore in Glencoe,
whose wild <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>gorge and frowning precipices are in view as we
write. But if any of our readers will feel cause of gratitude to the
mole on the hint above given, as they bend over a moss rose or dahlia
which has grown in soil so procured, why, we shall be glad for all our
sakes. For our reader&rsquo;s, in that he or she has been gratified in
such a delightful and holy taste as flower culture; for our own, that
the secret was ours to divulge; and for the mole&rsquo;s sake, poor
persecuted fellow, for he sadly needs a friend. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If somewhat over-showery for the comfort of tourists,
whose season [June 1871] may now be said to have fairly commenced, the
weather with us on the west coast is at least all that the
agriculturist and sheepowner could wish it to be, for pasture
everywhere is rich and abundant to a degree that has rarely been known
even here, while crops of all kinds never perhaps presented a healthier
or more luxuriant growth. The truth is that a certain amount of
rainfall, and that amount a large one, is absolutely necessary for the
wellbeing of our crops in the West Highlands, and the longer we live
the more do we feel the truth and force of the saying of a shrewd old
gentleman, at his own dinner table many years ago, to the effect that
he had always observed that the season in which there was some
difficulty in getting peats secured in good condition was invariably
the best for Lochaber and the neighbouring districts from a pastoral
and agricultural point of view. This is particularly observable this
year, for while you cannot as yet see a stack of this season&rsquo;s
peats anywhere, the country is clothed in richer, greener verdure, the
woods are leaner, and crops of every description more luxuriant than we
can recollect to have been the case for at least a dozen years past. If
anybody wishes to see the West Highlands in all their magnificence and
beauty, now is the season, for, go where you may, turn whithersoever
you will, wander forth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=
"#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>at any hour and in any direction,
you cannot fail to be charmed with the infinite variety of pictures
that present themselves for your admiration, pictures which, while they
only charm and enchant the ordinary beholder, delight at once and
distress the artist&mdash;delight him by their marvellous beauties, but
distress him not the less, because he cannot with all his cunning
transfer these beauties in their entirety to canvas. An American
gentleman whom we met the other day candidly confessed that, although
he had gone over most of his native land, and made the tour of
Continental Europe and the East, he had not in all his travels seen
anything more beautiful than the shores of Loch Linnhe, Loch Leven, and
Lochiel at sunset on a fine evening in June. The late Dr. Aiton of
Dolphinton told us on his return from Palestine that he had seen
nothing at all to equal Loch Linnhe on a summer&rsquo;s evening. In all
the breadth of his native Doric, which he always employed in familiar
conversation, he declared there was &ldquo;naething in a&rsquo; the
Archipelago till touch&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and we have heard Dr. Norman
Macleod on his return from India express himself very much to the same
effect. The Queen says in her <i>Journal</i> that &ldquo;the scenery in
Loch Linnhe is magnificent&mdash;such beautiful mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A specimen of a very rare bird, shot by the keeper in Ardgour Garden
a few days ago, has been kindly sent to us by Mr. Maclean. It turns out
to be a male in beautiful plumage of the turtle-dove (<i lang=
"la">Columba turtur</i>, Linn.; <i lang="fr">La tourterelle</i> of
Buffon), a bird rarely seen anywhere in Scotland, and which, except in
this instance, has never, so far as we are aware, been met with in the
West Highlands. We remember seeing a young bird, a female in immature
plumage, that was said to have been shot somewhere near Falkland Palace
in the summer of 1847, from which it was reasonably concluded that a
pair of these beautiful birds had in that year at least nidified and
reared their young somewhere in the Howe of Fife. Except in the case of
the specimen now before us, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>we are not aware that it has ever
been met with anywhere in the north or north-western counties. The
turtle is, as we have said, an exceedingly beautiful and handsome bird,
the breast of a delicate vinaceous tint, and a black patch on either
side of the neck, each feather of which is tipped with a crescent of
pure white, giving it a very elegant and striking appearance. It is
less bulky and less rotund in form than the common dove, its shape more
nearly resembling that of the blue jay or throstle cock, which latter
it also about equals in size. We have never seen this bird in
confinement, but it is said to exhibit a remarkable degree of
tenderness and sagacity, whether as a cage or chamber bird. On the
Continent it is kept not only for its tameness and beauty, but because
it is a common belief among the people that it attracts to itself bad
humours, and is to a family in the matter of diseases what a
lightning-rod is to a building in a thunderstorm. Bechstein, a shrewd
and intelligent man, seems to think that the belief in question, absurd
as it may appear to us, is not so ill-founded after all, for he says
quietly, &ldquo;Thus much at least is certain, that during the illness
of men it readily becomes sickly.&rdquo; The explanation probably is
that, being a tender and delicate bird, the odour and effluvia
attendant on certain human ailments affects it as described. Other
birds are occasionally similarly affected; thus, when our own children
were laid up with a very bad kind of scarlatina, our cage-birds, gold
and green finches, were out of sorts for some time, drooping and
dejected and unable to sing as usual, though the month was April, when
they should have been in all respects at their best and in full and
free song. You may be sure, by the way, that we were not a little
pleased with a paragraph which appeared the other day about the male
cockatoo that dropped the egg, very much, no doubt, to the astonishment
of his amiable mistress. When some years ago we ventured to assert that
males of various birds, notably the common domestic cock, sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>dropped an egg, the thing was scouted as
ridiculous, and from Dan to Beersheba, from London to John
O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s, the cry was that it couldn&rsquo;t be, that it
was impossible; one writer going so far in his scepticism as plainly to
declare that &ldquo;he would as soon believe that a bull had given
birth to a calf.&rdquo; Much was the chaffing that we had to endure in
connection with the subject, and our most intimate friends could hardly
believe that we were serious in it at all. And yet we were perfectly in
earnest; we had known the thing happen repeatedly, and since then a
very fine cock goldfinch of our own, one of the best singers, too, we
have ever heard, laid an egg in his cage which is still in our
possession, and several of our correspondents having had their
attention directed to the subject, have assured themselves that, not
only is the thing possible, but in the case of the domestic cock at
least, and of many cage-birds, of rather common occurrence. It is a
very odd and curious thing, no doubt, and difficult of explanation, but
there are thousands of undisputed facts in natural history in the same
category, the existence of which is beyond all question, though the
how, and why, and wherefore is a mystery.</p>
<p>From our window, as we write these lines, we can see quite a fleet
of herring boats sailing up Loch Linnhe on their return from the
fishing stations at Barra, Lochmaddy, and the Lewis&mdash;a very pretty
sight&mdash;not less than two hundred or more boats under full sail,
stretching in one long line from Corran Ferry to the Sound of Mull,
looking at this distance for all the world like the notes in a line of
complicated printed music. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With an occasional fine day [August 1871], the past
fortnight must, we fear, be characterised as having been upon the whole
wet&mdash;<i>very</i> wet, a stranger would say&mdash;and not a little
stormy withal. We had a tremendous thunderstorm early on Sunday
morning, with the most magnificent display of forked lightning that we
have ever seen, while the very earth seemed to quake and tremble under
the crash of peal upon peal of thunder, so near and loud at times as to
be absolutely terrible. It is no wonder that the soundest sleepers were
awakened from their midnight slumbers by the hurly-burly. We ourselves
got up for a time, and sat at our window, watching the lightning that
darted incessantly among the mountain summits with startling vividness,
revealing their serrated peaks at times through the very heart of the
thunder-cloud as distinctly as if it were clearest noonday. Rain, too,
fell the while in torrents, that instantly filled river and mountain
stream to overflowing; and as the storm passed away, and we retired to
rest in the grey, uncertain twilight of the early dawn, we were lulled
into a sleep, that lasted well nigh until noon, by the weird and wild
music of &ldquo;the noise of many waters.&rdquo; We thought, as we sat
alone in the midst of that magnificent storm, of him (was it John
Foster?) who, on a similar occasion, turned round to his companion and
remarked, in a tone of deep solemnity, &ldquo;It is a fine night;
<i>the Lord is abroad</i>!&rdquo; Crops, though generally further from
maturity than is usual at this date, continue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>to
grow rapidly, and everywhere present a strong and healthy
appearance,&mdash;&ldquo;a guarantee,&rdquo; as newspaper editors say,
&ldquo;of their good faith&rdquo; and honest intentions in the
direction of a bounteous yield when cometh the season of ingathering.
Potatoes are now in full flower; and a very pretty sight, if you deign
to look at it with an unprejudiced eye, is a potato field in blossom at
this season. If the incomparable esculent were not cultivated for its
utility and value as an article of food, it would still deserve a place
in our gardens for its elegance and beauty simply as a flower. Nothing
but its commonness causes its beauty as a flowering plant to be so
constantly overlooked. We are in the midst of our hay season, and we
are only anxious about good weather for securing it in tolerable order.
Eight consecutive days of dry, breezy weather would be of incalculable
value to us at this moment. Anything will grow, and grow luxuriantly,
on the West Coast: our difficulties only begin with the season of
ripening and after preservation. If there be any truth in the old
Scottish saying, that &ldquo;a year of nuts will also be a year of
corn,&rdquo; then may the grain-growers of the West Highlands at least
already congratulate themselves, for we have seldom seen the hazel
boughs so laden with nut clusters; and a prettier sight than a hazel
wood so laden, either now or when decked in its autumnal robes, it
would be difficult to conceive. It is, besides, a fragrant, cleanly
wood, through which you can at any time dash fearlessly and at will,
all the better of your contact with the leaves, branches, and nut
clusters, when you have reached the open beyond. There is not a leaf in
the woods so thoroughly clean, so fragrant when you have crushed it in
your hand, so soft and pleasant to the touch in its every stage, as the
leaf fresh plucked from the hazel bough. And <i>apropos</i> of hazel
nuts, a gentlemen from the south of England, at present resident in our
neighbourhood, told us something the other day that we did not know
before. &ldquo;In our part of England,&rdquo; observed our friend,
&ldquo;the hazel is common, and grows to a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>larger size, has more pretentions to the name of
tree, in fact, than here with you; and our nuts, I should say, must be
larger, juicier, and in all respects better than yours.&rdquo; (A
&ldquo;soft impeachment,&rdquo; at which, for the honour of Nether
Lochaber, we took the liberty of gravely shaking our head in token of
dissent). &ldquo;We seldom, however,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;can get
a ripe hazel nut in autumn, the reason being that in many places they
are gathered while yet in a half-formed and green state. You look
surprised, but the reason is this: the husk of the green, unripe hazel
nut is rich, as you must be aware, in a bitterly sharp and astringent
acid, that must have often made your teeth water when you have essayed
to crack a nut in a state of immaturity. This acid, then, you must
know, is valuable as a <i>mordant</i> (a technical term) in the
printing and dyeing of cotton and other fabrics, and it commands a high
price in the market accordingly. It is a maxim in commerce that demand
creates supply; and the consequence is, that every year in the month of
July, when the nuts are at their greenest, and the acid in their husks
at its acridest, women and children plunder the woods of their hazel
nut clusters, which are sold to the manufacturers, who, by a process of
crushing by machinery, and washing and maceration, extract all the
acid, to be employed, as I have already mentioned, in cotton printing
and dye works.&rdquo; So far in substance, if not in <i lang=
"la">ipsissimis verbis</i>, our friend. All we could reply was that we
should be sorry indeed to see our own bonny hazel woods similarly
despoiled. Another thing told us by this friend somewhat surprised us.
He observed our servant girl carrying a bundle of potato
&ldquo;shaws&rdquo; into the byre, and asked us what they were for. On
our replying that these were the shaws of the potatoes taken up for
dinner, and that they were thrown before the cows, and devoured by them
with avidity on their return from their hill pasture in the evening, he
earnestly advised us never to do so again; that in England it was never
done, because it was found that potato shaws given to milch cows
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>not only lessened the quantity of milk yielded,
but actually vitiated the milk itself, giving it a disagreeable taste,
and making it decidedly unwholesome. All we could answer was that we
had known potato shaws given to milch cows all over the Highlands since
ever we could remember, and that we had never known or heard any of the
evils stated to result from the use of them. What says the reader? It
is true, no doubt, that the potato belongs botanically to a family of
plants many of whom are highly poisonous&mdash;such as the common
<i>deadly nightshade</i> of our lanes and roadsides, for
example&mdash;and it is averred that, although the tuber of the potato
is healthy and nutritious when <i>cooked</i>, it is a poison in its raw
state, and that its stem, leaves, flower, and &ldquo;apple&rdquo; are
all more or less poisonous; and yet we have known boys, while the
blight was yet unheard of, and when potatoes were more prolific of
apples or plums than they have ever been since, eat the large, soft,
full, ripe apples with relish, and they never suffered the slightest
inconvenience in consequence that ever we heard of. As a boy we have
often ate them ourselves, and very saccharine, juicy, and pleasant
flavoured we recollect they were, not at all unlike the purple plum of
our gardens in taste and flavour, and hardly inferior to it as a
pleasant succulent <i lang="fr">bonne bouche</i>. Cattle, as we know,
will greedily eat the fresh shaws, as they will a decidedly poisonous
plant, the hemlock (<i>Celtic&egrave;, Iteotha</i>); and it is a
well-known fact that in severe cases of scurvy on board ships that have
to go long voyages a feast of <i>raw</i> potatoes is an immediate and
certain cure; so that after all it would seem that if the potato is
originally a poisonous plant, cultivation has eradicated all, or almost
all, traces of the evil. As to the deleterious effects of the shaws on
the milk of cattle we have our doubts, our amiable and learned friend
above mentioned to the contrary notwithstanding. And while on such
subjects let us record a piece of information received from an old
woman in our neighbourhood a few days ago. We were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>cutting some green ferns on the hillside, when
the old lady in question, who happened to pass the way at the time,
stood to have a crack with us about the weather and crops and things in
general, said crack concluding somewhat as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;You
are cutting ferns, sir,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;what are you
to make of them if you please, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;They are for
bedding,&rdquo; we replied, &ldquo;bedding for the cows and
pony.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;there is no
harm in bedding the pony with them; they will do <i>him</i> no evil;
but take an old woman&rsquo;s advice, and don&rsquo;t put them under
your cows.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why so,&rdquo; we asked in astonishment.
&ldquo;What can be cleaner, fresher, fragranter for bedding, whether
for horse or cow, than these nice green ferns? Just look how beautiful
and soft they are.&rdquo; &ldquo;Still, sir,&rdquo; she persisted,
&ldquo;you must not place them under your cows, particularly your milch
cows; if you do, their udders will assuredly fester, and they will go
wrong in their milk. I have known it happen often, and no sensible
person in the country ever does such a thing now-a-days. Ferns cut in
autumn when brown and ripe make excellent bedding for milch cows as for
all other cattle, but July cut ferns, green, juicy, and unripe, should
never be used for bedding milch cows. I do not pretend to tell you why
they should produce the evils I have mentioned, but I do know that if I
had fifty cows I had rather have them without bedding at all than put
such green, fresh ferns as those under them.&rdquo; We stood for the
moment aghast at this piece of information, which was perfectly new to
us, and from the positive and decided tone of the old lady, a shrewd
intelligent woman of her class, we felt that there must be something in
it. On inquiry we have since found that the old lady&rsquo;s belief in
the evil of ferns&mdash;green, unripe ferns, that is&mdash;as bedding
for milch cows, is common among the people of this part of the West
Highlands. Whether the whole affair is a mere superstition, the fern
having always been accounted a sacred plant in the Highlands,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>or whether there is really some foundation in
fact for the belief that a bedding of green ferns causes the udders of
cows to swell and fester as is alleged, we are not at this moment
prepared to say; perhaps some of our readers may be able to throw light
on the subject. It is just possible that green-cut ferns, when pressed
by the recumbent animal, may exude an acrid juice that, coming in
contact with the tender udder, may be absorbed with the effects
alleged. Meantime we doubt it. One thing we know is this, that cattle
are fond of lying down among growing ferns in their every stage, and
that both roe and red deer frequently make their lair among growing
ferns at this season. Do you remember, by the way, Scott&rsquo;s
magnificent description in <i>Marmion</i> of a fern-couched deer roused
from his midnight lair by the awful tolling of the passing-bell over
the living entombment of poor Constance in the monastery of
Lindisfarne?&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With such fine weather as we enjoy at present,
September [1871] is one of the pleasantest months of the year. Harvest
operations are now in full swing, and the redbreast&mdash;having
moulted, and proudly conscious of the splendour of his scarlet
vest&mdash;has already begun his autumnal song&mdash;more delectable
now and more appreciated, because now, with the exception of an
occasional voluntary from the wren, he only sings, whereas his vernal
strains are lost in their amalgamation with the full chorus of a
thousand performers. It is pleasant now, as you saunter or ride along,
to listen to the merry laughter of the reapers afield, and to their
song, as, <i lang="la">mor&ecirc; majorum</i>, it floats in chorus on
the gale: pleasant, too, to us at least, and far from unmusical, the
frequent sound of the whetting of scythe and sickle in every
direction&mdash;the bloodless weapons&mdash;as they are deftly handled
in the process, glancing brightly in the sunlight! Reaping
&ldquo;machines&rdquo; and &ldquo;steam&rdquo; ploughs may be very good
things in their way, but we are not ashamed to confess that we are glad
that, as yet at least, we know nothing of them in the West Highlands.
The utilitarian must be content if we admit all their value and
importance from <i>his</i> point of view, while at the same time we yet
assert that wherever they appear all the poetry of agriculture
incontinently becomes plain prose&mdash;<i lang="la">Sic transit gloria
Cereris</i>. Very excellent, at all events, are our crops this season,
and very excellently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span>are they being harvested. A good deal has
already been secured in barn and stackyard, and in such condition, too,
as is but rarely possible under the weeping skies of the west coast.
The weather is still so favourable that our people are working with a
will, and making every exertion to have their harvesting concluded
while it lasts. Potatoes still continue sound and untainted, although
an occasional <i>spottiness</i> of the leaf in some fields shows that
our old enemy the &ldquo;blight&rdquo; has not yet forgot the time of
his coming. The crop is now, however, about ripe, and may be considered
very much out of danger for the season. In our last, we had a good deal
to say about this invaluable root, and how it should be brought to
table; and to show that such a subject-matter is not quite so <i>infra
dig.</i> as some of our readers might suppose, listen to what the
<i>Times</i> says of Garibaldi&rsquo;s doings at Caprera. After
recounting the General&rsquo;s failures in connection with his orchard,
the acclimation of the silk-worm, &amp;c., the <i>Times</i>
proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;Garibaldi, however, points with exultation to
his potato fields. No species of the favourite root is neglected, and
there is no treat he so heartily enjoys as a dish of his own potatoes,
baked with his own hand under embers, in the open air&mdash;a treat
which calls up reminiscences of his camp life on the Tonale or the
Stelvis, or of his pioneer&rsquo;s experience in the backwoods of the
Mississippi or the Plate.&rdquo; We wonder if this &ldquo;hero in an
unheroic age,&rdquo; who yet disdains not to exult in his potato
fields, or to cook his delicious &ldquo;earth apples,&rdquo; as the
French so happily term them, in the embers with his own hand&mdash;we
wonder if he eats his fish with his fingers? We could lay a wager that
he does; that in eating his ember-roasted potatoes in the open air,
with some broiled <i>tunny</i>, let us suppose, as a fitting
accompaniment&mdash;(the Thynnus vulgaris, in highest esteem with the
ancients as with the moderns, abundant about Caprera and all the shores
of Proven&ccedil;e, Sardinia, and Sicily, and than which, indeed, there
is hardly any better fish)&mdash;we could lay a wager, we say, that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>in eating his potatoes and fish <i lang="it">al
fresco</i> he discards the use of knife and fork utterly, eating his
fish with his fingers, and using the running brook beside him as a
convenient finger-glass.</p>
<p>There is a lull at present in our herring fishing, rather because,
however, of the paramount claims of harvest operations on the attention
of our people just now, than from any dearth of the fish in our lochs.
In a week or ten days, when all or most of the corn has been cut, the
fishing will be resumed, and it is hoped with success. In an old
Fingalian tale it is very beautifully said&mdash;&ldquo;Rejoice, O my
son, in the gifts of the sea; for they enrich you without making any
one else the poorer.&rdquo; A rather rare fish in our western waters
was caught a few days ago by our excellent neighbour, J. P. Grant,
Esq., who occupies Cuilchenna House this season. Mr. Grant was good
enough to send this odd fish for our inspection, and we determined it
to be a species of <i>plaice</i> (<i lang="la">Platessa</i>)&mdash;and
the handsomest of the family&mdash;the <i lang="la">Platessa
gemmatus</i> of ichthyologists, commonly called the diamond or
diamond-spotted plaice. This very handsome fish is quite as good on the
table as it is beautiful when fresh from its native element. Another
fish, rare on the west coast, was captured by ourselves with the rod
while mackerel fishing last week. It was a specimen of the sapphirine
gurnard (<i lang="la">Trigla hirundo</i>), one of the family of
&ldquo;hard-cheeked&rdquo; fishes, of which the common red or cuckoo
gurnard (<i lang="la">Trigla cuculus</i>) is a familiar example. A
peculiarity in all the family is the abnormal development of the
pectoral fins, so large in one species as to enable it to fly bird-like
for short distances in the air. All our readers must have heard and
read of the flying-fish (<i lang="la">Trigla volitans</i>), even if
they have never seen it. It is of the gurnard family&mdash;a very near
relation, indeed, of our common gurnard. All the
&ldquo;hard-cheeked&rdquo; fishes, without exception, are excellent
eating. Our sapphirine gurnard was delicious.</p>
<p>We do not know whether any of our readers has observed it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>to be the case elsewhere, but in this and the
neighbouring districts we have again and again remarked how very
plentiful all kinds of mushrooms&mdash;the whole family of <i lang=
"la">Agarici</i>&mdash;are this season. Never have we seen so many
beautiful &ldquo;fairy rings,&rdquo; many of them almost mathematically
perfect circles. Although they are always interesting and beautiful,
you cannot help being a little startled, and feeling a shade of awe
mingling with your curiosity and admiration, as you suddenly come upon
one of these emerald rings in burnside meadow or upland glade, and
contrast the vivid green and well-defined periphery of the charmed
circle with the general every-day colour of the surrounding verdure. We
are not surprised&mdash;on the contrary, we can perfectly
understand&mdash;how in the good old times, ere yet the schoolmaster
was abroad, or science had become a popular plaything,
people&mdash;and, doubtless, very honest, decent people
too&mdash;attributed those inexplicable emerald circles to supernatural
agency; if, indeed, anything connected with the &ldquo;good
folks&rdquo; or &ldquo;men of peace&rdquo; could properly be called
<i>super</i>-natural in times when a belief in fairies, and every sort
of fairy freak and frolic, was deemed the most correct and natural
thing in the world. Didn&rsquo;t these circles, it was argued, appear
in the course of a single night? In the sequestered woodland glade, nor
herd nor milkmaid could see anything odd or unusual as the sun went
down, and, lo! next morning, as they drove their flocks afield, there
was the mysterious circle, round as the halo about the wintry moon. Was
not the colour, too, of these circles green, and not only green, but a
deeper, richer, and more vivid green than natural verdure is ever seen
to be? and whose work, therefore, could it be but that of the fairies,
whose own favourite, peculiar colour was green, that no mere mortal
durst wear but at his peril, and who, it was well known, delighted to
dance hand-in-hand in merry circles round, footing it featly, as the
owl flittered ghost-like by the scene, all by the silvery light of the
moon, until the dawn of day. As Tom D&rsquo;Urfey has it&mdash;

<p class="first">And if we know better now-a-days than to believe these
green circles to be fairy rings, we also know better than to give the
slightest credence to certain authors of our own day who have gravely
asserted that they are caused by electricity. We prefer the fairy
agency theory, as the more poetical and picturesque of the two, for, as
to the truth of either, why, the one is every whit as true as the
other. Fairy rings, as we continue for convenience sake to call them,
are, in truth, caused by a species of mushroom (<i lang="la">Agaricus
pratensis</i>), the sporule dust or seed of which, having fallen on a
spot suitable for its growth, instantly germinates, and constantly
propagating itself by sending out a net-work of innumerable filaments
and threads, forms the rich green rings so common everywhere this
season. On the outer edge of this ring, and sometimes also, though more
rarely, on the inner edge, grows the perfect plant, the fruit, the
mushroom proper itself; and if some of our modern wiseacres had only
had half an eye in their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>heads and the least particle of
gumption, they could easily have gone to the fields and seen all this
for themselves, instead of lazily theorising on the origin of the
apparent mystery in their dressing-gowns and slippers by the fireside,
and sagely ascribing the whole to the agency of electricity! There was
a time, you may remember, when it was the fashion to ascribe everything
that people didn&rsquo;t readily understand to electricity&mdash;very
convenient certainly, but if you pushed these <i>savans</i> a little,
and asked them what this electricity <i>itself</i> was, they were
incontinently dumb, or, if they talked, they were bound to talk
nonsense. We can forgive, and even admire, the fairy dance theory, for
it is full of poetry and beauty, and in an age when people seldom
troubled themselves to trace natural phenomena to their source, it was,
upon the whole, a rather happy conjecture; if it was not the actual
<i>vrai</i>, it had of <i lang="fr">vraisemblance</i> about it enough
to recommend it to the acceptance of the multitude. Grant but the
existence of fairies, and the rest was easy of belief. The
&ldquo;electricity&rdquo; theory, on the contrary, was unpardonable: it
was not only false in fact, but it had nothing whatever about it to
recommend it either to one&rsquo;s faith or fancy. Hardly more
excusable than the electricity theorists themselves are those authors
who tell us that the West received the first hint of the existence of
fairies from the East at the time of the Crusades, and that almost all
our fairy lore is traceable to the same source; the fact being,
nevertheless, that Celt and Saxon, Scandinavian and Goth, Lap and Fin,
had their &ldquo;duergar,&rdquo; their &ldquo;elfen,&rdquo; without
number, such as <i>dun-elfen</i>, <i>berg-elfen</i>, <i>munt-elfen</i>,
<i>feld-elfen</i>, <i>wudu-elfen</i>, <i>sae-elfen</i>, and
<i>waeter-elfen</i>&mdash;elves, or spirits, of downs, hills, and
mountains, of the fields, of the woods, of the sea, and of the rivers,
streams, and solitary pools&mdash;fairies, in short, and a complete
fairy mythology, long centuries before Peter the Hermit was born, or
Frank and Moslem dreamt of making the Holy Sepulchre a <i lang=
"la">casus belli</i>. It is a curious fact in connection with fairy
lore, and we have not seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>it noticed elsewhere, that
although these anomalous beings are always credited with much
capriciousness, and are constantly described as sensitive in the
extreme to anything like slight or insult, keenly vindictive in their
dispositions and easily irritated, they are never represented as
encompassing the <i>death</i> of human beings. They tease, terrify, and
torment in a thousand ways where they take a dislike, but they never
<i>kill</i>. Their power is described as great, but it is also
limited&mdash;the issues of life and death are beyond their reach. In
the fairy song (<i>temp.</i> Charles I.) first quoted, there are two
amusing verses indicating such pranks as fairies <i>could</i> play on
mortals, if mortals offended them. Thus concludes Queen Mab her
song:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The disappearance of the glories of Autumn, and the
advent of Winter&mdash;Innovations and Innovators&mdash;New Version of
the Scriptures&mdash;<i>The Milkmaid and her Fairy Lover</i>,
translated from the Gaelic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ichabod! the glory is departed [November 1871]. The
gorgeous autumnal hues, which were so beautiful when we penned our
last, have already passed away. In the first fierce breath of winter
the trees have shed their golden glories, while the few remaining
leaves that still cling trembling to branch and bough, shrivelled up
and blackened at their edges, present only that pallid, corpse-like hue
that betokens approaching dissolution, making you sad and thoughtful as
you gaze, and reminding you that everywhere, on all hands, last while
it may, the end of all life is death. It is a sad lesson for the
moment, doubtless, but a useful one; and even at its worst, when the
thought bears heaviest upon us, the cloud presents its silver lining,
and a gleam of gladness bursts upon the soul, in the recollection that
as sure as all things are subject to decay and death, so sure are decay
and death themselves but the vassals of a brighter life and more
excellent glory. In one of our Scripture Paraphrases there is a very
beautiful reference to the decay of nature at this season, and to the
hope that gladdens us amidst all the desolation of the
scene:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;All nature dies, and lives again:</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">The flow&rsquo;r that paints the field,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">We have no patience with your innovators, whether in
matters of Church or State. We do not deny, indeed, that certain
innovations may be sometimes permissible, even if not absolutely
necessary, that by their adoption things may be done more decently and
in order; nor do we object even to a radical change in a given
direction, when such a change has by common consent become imperative.
We believe, in fact, in development and progress; only let that
progress and development be slow and sure, that they may be lasting;
gradual, that they may be graceful, and fall easily into their place,
without unnecessary jostling or disturbance of the established order of
things. <i>Festina lente</i>&mdash;hasten slowly&mdash;was the motto of
the learned Erasmus, and <i>quoad hoc</i> it is ours also; and, if you
care to know it, is our creed in affairs political and ecclesiastical.
Some people, however, seem born to be innovators and nothing else, and
the innovator, <i>pure et simple</i>, is surely a pest. He seems to
have been born never to know peace himself, and never, as much as in
him lies, to permit others a moment&rsquo;s rest or peace, or quiet
either. Your thoroughbred, full-blooded innovator always reminds us of
our first housekeeper&mdash;a very good woman in her way, too, but who
had a perfect craze for shifting and reshifting, adjusting and
readjusting, as well as dusting and redusting every article of
furniture throughout the house, at all sorts of unseasonable hours, and
when to ordinary mortals such labour seemed utterly uncalled for. When
we were at home she went &ldquo;at it&rdquo; in out-of-the-way closets
and bedrooms as much and as often as the immediate calls of the moment
permitted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>But when she got us away from home for a day or
two, how she did enjoy it! How she did luxuriate in the power to
innovate &ldquo;at her own sweet will&rdquo;&mdash;the quotation, by
the way, is rather inapt, for her temper was somewhat of the sourest.
Sometimes when we came back after a day or two&rsquo;s absence, we
could hardly believe it to be the same house, so great was the change
in the place and position of everything. At last the thing became
unbearable. One evening, on our return from a walk, we found our
writing-table, at which we had been employed during the day, carefully
placed in the darkest corner of the room, with its drawers, containing
letters, paper, pens, &amp;c., jammed up hard and fast against the
wall, while books and manuscripts were most artistically arranged in
pyramidal form, the ink-bottle representing the graceful entablature on
the top of a book-case, where it must have cost her no small pains, and
a great deal of stretching on tip-toe, even with the aid of a chair, to
place them. The thing was too absurd for any one to be really angry;
but we pretended to be so, and at last peace was proclaimed, under a
sort of compromise that she should arrange and readjust all the rest of
the house at her pleasure, as often and as radically as she chose, but
that <i>that</i> particular room, having been put to rights to our
mutual satisfaction once for all, must in all time coming be let alone.
This treaty being duly ratified, was upon the whole faithfully observed
by the contracting parties. The mischief, however, with your
thoroughbred innovator is that you can never completely satisfy him,
his appetite for change is insatiable, he will make no compromise with
you. Grant him all he asks to-day, and as sure as to-morrow comes, he
is at it anew. If you gave him the whole world, and his own way
everywhere and in everything, he would be in worse plight than the
conqueror who wept because there were no more worlds to subdue, and
fret himself to death that there were no more changes for him to
effect. The probability is that, rather than be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>idle, he would, in hunting phrase, &ldquo;hark
back&rdquo; upon his old track, and diligently undo all he had spent
his life in doing, and without much regard to the consequences.</p>
<p>We have been led into these remarks by the recollection, when
quoting the above verses of the Eighth Paraphrase, that there are at
this moment some people busily bestirring themselves in the matter of a
new translation of the Scriptures, to supersede the authorised version
now in use. Now, we most solemnly protest against all this, as a most
rash proposal, ill-advised, and utterly uncalled for. At present we
object very much on the same principle that we should object to a
painting by one of the old masters being cleansed and retouched by a
modern R.A., however eminent in his own person, or on the same
principle that we should feel tempted to kick the ladder from under the
feet of a man we should detect white-washing a stately pile of the
olden time, under the plea, forsooth, that in obliterating weather
stains, and freely applying putty and paint, he was thereby improving,
renovating, and beautifying the whole fabric. That there are verbal
inaccuracies in our authorised version of the Scriptures is on all
hands admitted; let these be rectified, if people please, and let the
corrections so made, under adequate authority, appear in the form of
marginal notes opposite the passage amended, but let the body of The
Book stand as it is&mdash;intact. The edifice, as it exists, is too
grand, and stately, and beautiful, and hallowed, not to suffer under
the proposed remodelling, even in the most competent hands.</p>
<p>But to turn to a different theme. The following is a translation
from the Gaelic, as literal as we could make it, with anything like due
regard to the spirit and manner of the original. It is a fairy song, if
song it can be called, from the manuscript volume referred to in a
former communication. Fairy tales, both in prose and verse, were common
with our Celtic forefathers, and, if we only examine them with
sufficient care, we shall find that, underlying all their quaintness,
there is always to be found a substratum of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=

whither he goeth. Having met and loved, however, she is instantly to
consult those who are older and wiser than herself, and, under their
friendly care and direction, she is to be sure that, on her own part
and on that of her lover, all shall be pure and holy. The touch at the
end is admirable. We must suppose a mother telling the story, herself
and sons and daughters sitting round the fire, which, in the absorbing
interest of the tale, has been for the time neglected.
&ldquo;Annabel,&rdquo; addressed at the close, we must fancy to be the
eldest daughter, just entering upon womanhood. The whole moral of the
story, flung obliquely at her head in the command to stir the fire and
make it blaze, is exquisite, and we can fancy the gentle
&ldquo;Annabel&rdquo; quietly smiling to herself the while&mdash;she
also having a secret&mdash;as she cheerily obeys the maternal mandate.

<p class="first">Wild Birds&rsquo; Nests in early April&mdash;Rook
stealing Eggs frightened and almost captured&mdash;The Domestic
Cock&mdash;What he was, and what he is&mdash;Sadly demoralised by
intermixture with &ldquo;Cochin-Chinas&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Bramahpootras.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After a month&rsquo;s cold, clear weather, with dry,
parching, northerly winds&mdash;the finest heather-burning season that
ever was seen&mdash;a considerable rainfall during the past week has
been welcomed as a boon rather than otherwise, and the country around
is all the greener and gladder because of it [April 1872.] During an
afternoon&rsquo;s ramble on Saturday we found a redbreast&rsquo;s nest,
a blackbird&rsquo;s, and a chaffinch&rsquo;s, all with their full
complement of eggs in them; while the nests of several other species,
some completed and some still abuilding, were to be found by diligent
searching in almost every likely locality. For many years past there
has been no such favourable season for wild birds. An amusing scene a
day or two ago was the following:&mdash;One of our hens, disregarding
the companionship of the rest, and desirous of more freedom of action,
in a matter so important, than the hen-house could supply, took to
laying her eggs in a hole she had scratched out under an old hazel root
in a neighbouring copse. Complaints were by-and-by brought into the
house that although this hen regularly dropped her quotidian egg in the
spot selected, it was found that, unless immediately taken away from
her, the egg was sure to be sucked by some sly thief who doubtless
enjoyed such a delicacy at this season amazingly, and all the more so,
we daresay, that his pilferings had hitherto passed undetected, despite
the strictest vigilance on the part of those more immediately
interested. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>was very annoying, as you may believe, morning
after morning to find the fresh and pearly shell at the nest&rsquo;s
side, its contents abstracted through a gaping hole in its bulge,
instead of the snowy treasure, <i lang="la">totus, teres atque
rotundus</i>, as it should be. Appealed to for such assistance as we
could render in detecting and punishing the culprit, whoever he might
be, we began by setting a trap for ground vermin, properly baited, and
as cunningly as possible placed, but without result. Determined,
however, to discover the petty larcenist, if possible, we took
advantage of an idle forenoon last week to sit and watch the nest from
a distance, our object in the first instance being to find out who the
depredator really was; we could afterwards and at our leisure take such
steps as we might deem advisable for his capture. Selecting a
convenient spot whence we could see without being seen, and provided
with a powerful binocular, we watched and waited with the most
exemplary diligence and patience, and were rewarded, after some time,
by discovering the culprit to be neither rat, stoat, nor weasel, nor
other quadrupedal marauder, but a common crow, or rook
rather&mdash;<i lang="la">Corvus frugilegus</i>, Linn&aelig;us calls
him, though <i lang="la">Corvus omnivorus</i> would be nearer the
mark&mdash;a large old male bird, as he afterwards proved to be, who
had doubtless in his day sucked many an egg and sacked many a homestead
of its callow fledglings. We first observed him alighting on the branch
of a large ash tree, whence he had a full view of the nest, and there
he sat with much patience, preening his feathers, and uttering an
occasional <i>craa</i>, as if to encourage the hen in her labours. No
sooner did the latter, having deposited her egg, leave the nest with
the usual cackle of self-congratulation, than Monsieur Corvus glided
from his perch, and in a twinkling, by the dexterous use of head and
bill, had the egg rolled out on the grass by the nest&rsquo;s side.
Turning it round and round, and rolling it over and over, stepping back
at times as if the better to contemplate its pearly whiteness and
handsome <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>proportions, and already in imagination rolling
the sweet morsel under his tongue, he finally stepped forward, and with
his pick-axe-like bill delivered a stroke at the egg&rsquo;s bigger
end, which made a sufficiently large hole for him to suck away at
comfortably. And how he did seem to enjoy it! Removing his bill now and
again as if to draw breath, and looking up and around with an air of
innocence and self-satisfaction that was exceedingly comical.
Meanwhile, so intent was <i lang="la">Corvus</i> on his egg-flip, that
we managed to creep quite close to the scene unperceived by him,
resolved to give him a good fright at least, if we could do no more. We
took advantage of a moment when he had his head buried in the egg up to
the eyes to start to our feet, uttering at the instant a favourite
shout of ours in such circumstances&mdash;a sort of war-whoop, a
legacy, we suppose, from our Fingalian ancestors&mdash;and the
happiness of <i lang="la">Corvus</i>, sucking his egg in such fancied
security, vanished like a dream. With a prolonged <i>cra-a-a</i> he
made a sudden dig into the egg in his fright, his bill passing clean
through it, and spreading his wings he fluttered upwards, the egg
sticking over his bill and eyes like a mask, and preventing him from
seeing anything, and causing him to perform the most ridiculous
evolutions ever exhibited perhaps by a bird on wing. Fluttering along
obliquely, with many a dolorous <i>cra-a</i>, he came to the ground
like a collapsed balloon in a neighbouring field, where we hoped to
capture him, but just as we ran up to him he managed to shake the egg
from his head, and in an instant was up and away and out of sight at a
rate that must have brought him to Culloden Moor within the hour if he
stopped not by the way. A bird rarely fails to profit by experience,
least of all a crow, and we have no hesitation in saying that the
particular rook in question will remember his egg-shell mask and our
unearthly war whoop till his dying hour.</p>
<p>And while on such subjects, let us ask the reader by the way if
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>he has noticed that cocks don&rsquo;t crow
now-a-days as they used to do? We refer of course to the common
barndoor fowl&mdash;<i lang="la">Gallus domesticus</i>, the domestic
cock. He, we assert, does not now-a-days crow with the same regularity
and timeousness, nor with the clear, clarion notes with which he
did</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Salutation to the morn,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">say a score of years ago. This may seem a startling
assertion, but any one who deigns to turn his attention to the subject
will find that it is true. The cock-crowing and wing-clapping of the
House of Commons when in the humour is no doubt highly creditable to
that august assembly. (It was Boswell, if we recollect well, who
imitated the lowing of a cow to admiration, and was naturally very
proud of so rare an accomplishment.) But the march of civilisation, and
cross-breeding, which you may call &ldquo;internationalism&rdquo; if
you like, have been the ruin of our cocks, so far as crowing is
concerned. They may weigh more than they did a score of years ago, and
present a plumper form on the table, but their crowing is gone: at the
best it is but a harsh, spasmodic, unmusical half-scream half-wheeze,
altogether unlike the loud and lusty, the clear, ringing notes of the
cock-crowing of our boyhood days. Our cocks are no longer chanticleers,
but chantiqueers. If you have occasion to sit up at night, or to start
on a journey betwixt midnight and morning, the cock no longer lends you
any countenance or aid in the matter&mdash;he sleeps on his perch in
utter oblivion of the passing hours, and as heedless of the
&ldquo;watches of the night&rdquo; as the brooding hen in the coop
beneath him. The day may dawn, and the sun may flood the mountain peaks
with light, glad and golden, without a note of welcome or recognition
on the part of the bird that, from the earliest ages until recent
years, was known as the herald of the dawn, and deservedly held in high
honour and esteem as the vigilant sentinel of the homestead throughout
the midnight and early morning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169"
href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>hours. Any convivial
&ldquo;Willie&rdquo; whom it so pleases may now brew his &ldquo;peck
o&rsquo; maut,&rdquo; if the Inland Revenue will let him, and sit down
to enjoy it with his boon companions into all the hours of the night
and morning, unwarned of the flight of time by anything like a
cock-crow. The moon may fill her silver horn, and shine bright as
aforetime, &ldquo;to wile them hame,&rdquo; and the day may
&ldquo;daw,&rdquo; but the cock&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>crawing</i>&rdquo;
will no longer convey its notes of warning and expostulation. If the
bird crows at all, it is sometime throughout the day, generally, we
have noticed, in the afternoon, when nobody thanks him for it, and then
in notes so discordant as to make your teeth water, as if you had
suddenly bitten deep into an unripe apple, with the chance of a
headache for the rest of the evening. The last time we heard a cock
crow in the good old fashion was in an out-of-the-way corner of
Arisaig, some three years ago. Being a stranger in the place, and
having to sleep on a &ldquo;shake-down&rdquo; on the floor of our room,
our sleep was less sound than usual, but throughout the night we were
cheered by the companionship of a cock that was roosting in an
out-house not far from our window. Shortly after midnight he announced
the first watch of the night as ended, and afterwards at intervals, of
as nearly as possible two hours, his clear, clarion notes, repeated two
or three times, startled the stillness of the glen, until at last the
rising sun invited him to the labours of the day, and called us to boot
and saddle. Nor is the degeneracy and demoralisation of the modern
domestic cock less apparent in another direction. Surrounded by his
harem, he used to be considered the <i>beau-ideal</i> by common consent
of all that is gallant, and courteous, and brave. With proud step and
stately bearing he led his dames about, finding for them the sunniest
spots wherein to bask and dust themselves when the day was at its
height. He diligently searched for, and rarely failed to find, the
particular corner wherein food was most abundant, scratching with might
and main that the ladies of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>court might have as little
unnecessary trouble as possible, rarely eating anything himself until
they had first of all picked the best and biggest share; and if he came
across any dainty titbit that his followers had overlooked, he took it
up in his bill, and by certain peculiar notes reserved for such
occasions, called them around him, dropping the toothsome morsel with
strict impartiality at his feet, to be picked up by the first to
respond to his summons. Now all this is changed. They may sun and dust
themselves when and where they please, or not at all, for all he cares.
Instead of being the active leader and gallant protector in feeding
excursions, he is content to be no more than as any other of the band,
exhibiting the utmost selfishness and greed in gobbling up the first
grain-pickle or earthworm that comes in the way, nor is he, <i>proh
pudor!</i> ashamed even to cuff and drive away his decidedly better
halves, when the mean wretch has, by accident rather than by any
diligence of his own, fallen on a good scratching-place. Neither do you
find in the cock of the present day the pugnacity and pluck, the
indomitable courage and love of warfare, once so characteristic of the
genus, from the tiniest bantam to the lordliest gamecock, that would
rather die than cry quarter or show the white feather to an opponent.
We don&rsquo;t suppose that the reader, any more than ourselves, has
seen a cock-fight for years; not from any elevation of morals, we
submit, in Monsieur Gallus, or increase at all of amiability, but from
sheer poltroonery and want of pluck. He will still bully about among
his hens, and fight with them, and we have seen some of them turn upon
him and give him a good drubbing, as he deserved; but a fair stand-up
fight with another cock&mdash;oh no, we never mention it!&mdash;he has
still the spurs, but no longer the heart for it. When afield at the
head of his following; if the shadow of a suspicious bird on wing, as
likely to be a crow as a gled or hawk, or other bird of prey, passes
along, instead of the old warning note to his wives, with preparation
on his own part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171"
name="pb171">171</a>]</span>to receive the enemy <i lang=
"fr"><span class="corr" id="xd26e4590" title=
"Source: &aacute;">&agrave;</span> l&rsquo;outrance</i>, be he who he
may, he is the first himself, in Yankee phrase, to skedaddle and make
tracks for a place of security and shelter, leaving his hens to their
fate. Our bill of indictment <i lang="la">contra gallum</i>, the reader
may say, is a heavy one, but it is in the main very true, as any one
who chooses may satisfy himself when he has the opportunity. How, then,
do we account for it? Well, it is very difficult satisfactorily to
account for it in any way. We are inclined to the belief that the
demoralisation of our domestic cock is to be traced to the introduction
into our country of such splay-footed, loutish, awkward fowls as the
&ldquo;Cochin China,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bramahpootra&rdquo; <i lang="la">et
hoc omne genus</i>, whose brains seem to have subsided into the
feathers on their feet, and whose only good quality is their size, and
even that is dearly purchased, we suspect, when the immense feeding
they require is taken into account. These fowls have spread everywhere,
so that, except in some out-of-the-way localities, a cock or hen of the
old native breed, of blood pure and uncontaminated by foreign
intermixture, is very rarely to be met with, while cross-breeds and
mongrels of every shape and size are abundant in all directions.
Whatever the good qualities of these latter in other respects, courage,
gallantry, and pluck are not of the number. Just inquire into the
subject for yourself, good reader, and you will find that, neither
physically, intellectually, nor morally is the cock of the present day
to be compared for a moment with the gallant, handsome, proud-stepping
biped of your boyhood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=

<p class="first">The vernal equinox has come and gone, unaccompanied
this year [April 1872], as it was unheralded and unannounced, by
anything like the storms that from the earliest times have been
observed to be attendant on the sun&rsquo;s crossing the equator. It is
by no means certain, however, that these storms may not even now be
a-brewing, to make themselves yet felt in all their fierceness, for we
have noticed in recent years particularly that what are called the
&ldquo;equinoctial gales&rdquo; quite as frequently follow, as
accompany or precede, the exact equality of day and night. We have just
had a fortnight of genuine March weather&mdash;clear, cold days, and
frosty nights&mdash;the air snell and biting, to be sure, and keen of
edge, as might be expected on the uplands; but in places sheltered from
the east and north it is delightfully bright and sunny, the incessant
song of birds, the hum of wild bees, and the gay fluttering of early
butterflies, making one think of Whitsuntide rather than All
Fools&rsquo; Day; the twittering of swallows and the cheery notes of
the cuckoo alone are wanting to make the illusion perfect, and these,
unless the weather should undergo some extraordinary and unexpected
change, must certainly soon be heard, much earlier this year, we should
think, than usual. We are particularly favoured in this respect along
the northern shores of Loch Leven. Here, to quote Burns&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">During the present clear, cold spring nights the
starry heavens are very beautiful. Jupiter, just below Castor and
Pollux, is at his brightest, and very favourably situated for
observation, his cloudy belts and bright diamond-point-like satellites
being visible in an instrument of very moderate powers. If between nine
and ten o&rsquo;clock the reader will turn to the north-east, he will
find a constellation pretty high up in the heavens, and consisting of
five or six principal stars, none of them, however, of the first
magnitude, opening towards the pole star in the form of a widely
spread-out W. This constellation will be an object of more than usual
interest during the present year. It is <i>Cassiopeia</i>, or <i>The
Lady in her Chair</i>, the scene of a very startling and strange
phenomenon in 1572, which, it has been asserted with some confidence,
is not at all unlikely to be repeated in 1872. In 1572 a new star of
great splendour appeared in Cassiopeia, occupying a place that had
hitherto been blank. It was first observed on the 6th August, by
Schuler, of Wittemburg, shortly after which it arrested the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>attention of the celebrated Danish astronomer
Tycho Brahe, who watched its rapid increase of brilliancy night after
night with the liveliest interest. Its magnitude at last rivalled, if
it did not even exceed, that of Jupiter, with an effulgence equally
bright and vivid. After shining with great splendour some time, and
attracting the earnest gaze of the most distinguished <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4655" title="Source: astromomers">astronomers</span> of
the period, its brilliancy began steadily to decline, changing its
colour in a very remarkable manner as it became fainter and fainter,
until finally it became invisible in March 1574, and has never been
seen since. Sir John Herschel and other astronomers have suggested that
its reappearance in 1872 is by no means an improbable event; and
towards no constellation in the northern heavens, in consequence, will
the observer&rsquo;s eye be so constantly turned throughout the present
year as to Cassiopeia. The reappearance of such a star would be certain
to give rise to the most startling theories. With the spectroscope in
our possession, however, and the marvellous telescopic power at our
command now-a-days, we could not fail to arrive at more intimate terms
with such a stranger than was possible in the days of Tycho Brahe. The
interest and excitement in the astronomical world in connection with
the sudden burst of splendour in the star in <i>Corona</i> a year or
two ago was very great, but would be still greater in the event of the
reappearance of the long absent stranger in Cassiopeia. In the one case
it was only a remarkable increase of light and lustre in the star
already existent and visible; but the reappearance of a new orb in a
spot blank and starless in the most powerful telescopes for three
hundred years, would be almost equal to the sudden creation of a new
sun. Here, by the way, good reader, if you are ambitious, is a chance
for fame. Be but the first to detect the reappearance of this
remarkable star-stranger, and your immortality into all time shall be
more secure than if you wrote an epic to rival the <i>Iliad</i>, or a
tragedy equal to <i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Othello</i>. The name and memory
of George Palitch, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>amateur peasant astronomer, who
was so fortunate as to obtain the earliest glimpse of Halley&rsquo;s
Comet on its first return to perihelion after its periodicity had been
so boldly, and as some thought so rashly asserted, is more secure in
that connection than if, either as king or conqueror, he had all the
honours of the most imperishable brass or marble.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago or more, when Highlanders were more
superstitious than they are now, or when, to be more correct, they took
less pains to conceal their superstitious beliefs than at the present
day, a certain hamlet in a remote part of the country was sadly
troubled by an &ldquo;evil eye,&rdquo; whose unhallowed powers wrought
&ldquo;mickle woe,&rdquo; to the manifest loss and discomfort of the
good people around. The cows no longer yielded their lacteal treasures
in the desired abundance, nor did the calves grow and thrive, as calves
in good keeping should. Churns, however shaken and jolted, refused to
turn out their hebdomadal pot of butter; or if, after much weary
labour, they did reluctantly yield any, it was found to be pale and
rancid as unsalted suet in the dog-days. Stirks and other young
&ldquo;beasts,&rdquo; though the rents depended on them, sickened and
dwined and died, without apparent reason; and even children, hitherto
in rude and ruddy health enough, were frequently prostrated by sudden
and unaccountable illnesses. That an &ldquo;evil eye&rdquo; of more
than ordinary virulence and power was at work was at last conceded even
by the most sceptical as to such influences, and suspicion straightway
fell upon a lone old woman, who lived in a hut on the outskirts of the
township. Originally a stranger to the district, and of a taciturn and
retiring disposition, she had long been looked upon with suspicion and
dislike, and now a number of young men resolved to be revenged on her
as the secret author of all that was amiss in the hamlet. At a late
hour one dark night they proceeded to the poor old woman&rsquo;s hut,
with the intention of setting fire to the roof and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>burning it about her ears, not caring very much
either even if the &ldquo;evil-eyed witch&rdquo; herself, as they
called her, should be buried under the burning rafters of her cottage.
As the young men noiselessly surrounded the hut, they found that the
old woman was just about retiring for the night, and as some of them
stood at her window, and looked and listened, they could see her, by
the light of a bog pine fire, kneel at her bedside, and after a little
they heard her repeat the following prayer:&mdash;</p>

continued to live the same quiet, unobtrusive life a few years longer,

<p class="first">Along the west coast the weather is now [May 1872] as
mild and May-like as you could wish; the swallow twitters gaily in the
sunlight, and when he ceases his zig-zag flight for a moment to rest on
chimney-top or house-ridge, he sings a gladsome song, low and faint
indeed, and frequently lost on that account in the general chorus, but
exceedingly sweet and musical, as you will find if you give it the
attention it merits; while in the distance you hear the cheery notes of
the cuckoo, wild and startling as yet, as they burst suddenly upon the
ear from out the woodland glade or from the old rowan tree that finds
root room, you wonder how, in yonder crevice in the rock above the
foaming waterfall, but soon to become familiar as the season advances,
and pressed upon your notice whether you will or no, and at all sorts
of impossible times and places, by the truant schoolboy&rsquo;s
oft-repeated, though rarely successful, attempts at imitation. For the
first week in May the temperature is unusually high, and we do not
recollect ever before having seen insect life so plentiful so early in
the season. Midges, gadflies, and other bloodsuckers are already astir
in their thousands, their taste for their favourite fluid keen and
unabated, as they fail not abundantly to manifest by an activity that
one cannot help admiring, even while wishing that it could possibly be
directed to a more legitimate and less personally annoying end. But
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis their nature to,&rdquo; as the hymn-book says, and we
must grin and bear it, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>protecting ourselves from their
assaults as best we may, thankful the while that the evil is no worse.
Our winged pests are innocence itself compared with their congeners in
other lands. Our midge, for instance, is to the mosquito as the
dog-fish is to the shark, as the domestic cat is to the tiger; while
our gadflies and <i>&AElig;stri</i>, though sufficiently annoying to
our cattle at certain seasons, are to be regarded as absolutely
harmless if we compare them with the venomous <i>Zimb</i> of Abyssinia,
or the still deadlier <i>Tsetse</i> of Southern Africa. The Abyssinian
insect, by the way&mdash;the <i>Zimb</i>&mdash;is probably the
<i>Zebub</i> of the Hebrew Scriptures, the estimation in which it was
held from the earliest ages being clearly enough indicated by its place
in the word Beelzebub, &ldquo;the prince of devils.&rdquo;
Livingstone&rsquo;s account of the <i>Tsetse</i> is one of the most
interesting chapters in his <i>Travels</i>. Shall the intrepid explorer
be restored to us? We are afraid not. It is only too probable that, as
Scott said of his <i>proteg&eacute;</i> and friend, the author of the
<i>Scenes of Infancy</i>&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The districts of Ardgour and Sunart have always had an
unenviable notoriety for the great numbers of adders and grass snakes
to be found in them, the reptiles frequently attaining to a size
unknown, we believe, anywhere else in the West Highlands. Within the
last two or three years we have noticed that they are rapidly becoming
numerous in Lochaber, much more so than they used to be, though the
general opinion, in which we heartily concur, is that we were getting
on very well without them. During an ornithological ramble among the
hills a few days ago, we knelt to drink at a fountain that we fell in
with, welling up cool and sparkling beside a large moss-covered drift
boulder among the heather, when we were not a little startled by the
presence of no less than three adders that lay coiled together in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>a sort of Gordian knot on a patch of green moss
close by the fountain&rsquo;s brink. The day was hot and dry, and they
had probably come there to drink and bathe; but we were very thirsty,
having just smoked a pipe on the top of the hill, and there being no
appearance of water anywhere else for miles around, and knowing,
besides, that there could be really no danger, even if the vipers had
been ten times larger and more venomous than they were, we drank a long
draught of the pure sweet water, and then proceeded with the stick in
our hand to attack the enemy, and soon had the satisfaction of knocking
them into wriggling, writhing bits, and crushing their heads under our
heel. Our assault was so sudden and unexpected that they had no time to
show fight; otherwise an adder, when his blood is up and thoroughly on
his guard, is an ugly customer to attack with no better weapon than a
walking-stick, and nothing can be imagined more deadly, wicked-looking,
and savage than such an animal, as with erected crest and flashing eye
he steadies himself in act to strike. It is curious that the poison of
these reptiles, though certain death if commingled in sufficient
quantity with the blood through an abrasion or wound, is perfectly
innocuous if taken into the stomach&mdash;a fact, by the way, that has
been known from very early times. On taking our drink, for instance,
from yonder viper-guarded fountain, we recollected that Lucan had
something on a somewhat similar circumstance in his <i lang=
"la">Pharsalia</i>. Describing Cato and his soldiers coming to a
fountain of water in the desert, and how horrified they were to find
innumerable serpents of the deadliest kind&mdash;asps and
dipsades&mdash;disporting themselves in and around the pool, he has the
following fine passage, the finest indeed in the poem, which we took
care to turn up when we reached home:&mdash;</p>

however, to be careful that the lips and palate are free from any cut
or excoriation by which the venom might find its way into the blood, in
which case it might be just as dangerous as if introduced into the
circulation by the fang itself. It should be stated that the grass or
ringed snake spoken of above is not in the least poisonous, though ugly
enough to look at, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href=
"#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>ready enough to assume a
threatening attitude if rudely disturbed. Nor, by the way, is the date
of the present writing inappropriate to the discussion of such a
subject, as we have at this moment discovered by the merest accident.
The 6th of May you will find is a Saint&rsquo;s day in the Calendar,
being dedicated to St. John <i lang="la">ante Portam Latinam</i>, the
legend connected with which is as follows:&mdash;The Beloved Disciple,
after preaching the Gospel in various parts of the world, was in his
old age taken to Rome by the Emperor Domitian, and because he refused
to renounce the religion of Christ, was put into a cauldron of boiling
oil before the Latin Gate&mdash;<i lang="la">Porta
Latina</i>&mdash;which, however, did him no more harm than did
Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s fiery furnace to Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego; on the contrary, John came out of the cauldron rejuvenated,
younger, fairer, and more beautiful than before. Afterwards a cup of
deadliest poison was given him to drink, but as he was putting it to
his lips, the poison, assuming the appropriate shape of a venomous
serpent, glided from the cup, leaving the draught harmless and pure. He
was finally banished to Patmos, where he wrote the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Old Fingalian rhymes and proverbs having reference to dogs and the
hunting of the stag, as it was then pursued, are very common in the
Highlands, and show how devoted to the chase were our Celtic ancestors.
Our neighbour, the Rev. Mr. Clerk of Kilmallie, in his splendid edition
of <i>Ossian</i>, gives some of these old rhymes in his very
interesting and learned notes on <i>Fingal</i>. The following was sent
us a short time ago, and as it has never appeared in print, we present
it to the reader with a liberal translation. We are always glad to be
able to rescue from oblivion even the smallest shred of the folk-lore
of the olden time. The story goes that this rhyme was first of all
taught by a fairy to a gay young hunter &ldquo;of the period,&rdquo;
under the following circumstances:&mdash;Once upon a time, a sprightly,
green-robed fairy, a sort of princess in her way, fell in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>love
with a young Fingalian hunter, who had frequent occasion, on his way to
and from the chase, to pass the <i>shian</i> or green knoll in which
the fairy band of the glen had taken up their abode. The fairy and her
hunter lover had frequent opportunities of meeting in secret, until
some evil-disposed sister fairy divulged Brianag&rsquo;s&mdash;for that
was the fairy&rsquo;s name&mdash;imprudent and unfairy-like conduct to
the powerful fairy prince A&euml;rlunn, who was himself over head and
ears in love with the beautiful Brianag, though she gave him no
encouragement at all; on the contrary, she flatly told him that, great
and powerful as he was, she did not love him in the least, and would
have nothing to do with him. On hearing how things were going on,
A&euml;rlunn was very jealous and very angry, just as a mortal might be
under similar circumstances, and he issued an edict, as Prince of the
Fairies of that glen, by which, after reflecting severely on the
unfairy-like conduct of Brianag and others of the band, he prohibited
Brianag from leaving the <i>shian</i> on any pretence whatever, except
for the one hour before midnight on the night when the moon completed
her first quarter&mdash;perfect liberty to do as they like during this
one hour in the month is every fairy&rsquo;s birthright, and no power
can deprive them of it. He would have done something very dreadful to
Brianag&rsquo;s lover, only the latter was protected from any evil a
fairy enemy could do to him by a talisman of extraordinary value, which
his uncle, a priest of the Druids, had given him, and which he always
carried on his person. Brianag and her lover were thus able to meet for
one hour in every month, despite the opposition of the angry
A&euml;rlunn, whose jealousy became at last so insupportable, that he
resolved to shift his court and people from that glen to another at a
great distance. To this arrangement, much as she regretted it, as it
separated herself and her lover, Brianag dare not object. It is a
prerogative appertaining to the Princes of Fairyland that they can
shift their court at will, when and whither they please. The fairy
palace thus forsaken is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>still to be seen in Glen Etive,
and has ever since been called <i lang="gd">An Sithean
Samhach</i>&mdash;the Quiet or Deserted Fairy Knoll. On parting with
her lover at their last interview, Brianag presented him with a silver
horn, whose blast could be heard, loud and clear, over the Seven Hills
and across the Seven Glens; and knowing that it was his ambition to
excel all others in the chase, she instructed him as to the best kind
of dog to have and hunt withal as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">While mild and May-like enough in the valleys and
along the coast line, the weather [May 1872] is reported as having more
of March than May about it on the uplands, owing to the prevalence of
north-easterly winds, that are at once exceedingly piercing and
unseasonably <i>snell</i>. It is pleasant at the same time to have to
report that, so far, crops of all kinds look extremely well, and have
seldom been seen so forward in mid-May. Potatoes have been
distinguishable from field&rsquo;s end to field&rsquo;s end in regular
drills for ten days past, and in some instances are already undergoing
their first weeding and hoeing. Oats show a strong, healthy braird, and
nothing but a deficiency of moisture in its present stage can prevent
ryegrass from being the best crop that has been known in the West
Highlands for many years. Much, however, will depend on the nature of
the weather for the next fortnight: those who should know best say that
the country would be all the better of more or less rain on every day
for the remainder of the month, and we daresay they are right. The
lambing season has hitherto been a highly favourable one, though the
drought and the keen-edged easterly winds are beginning to be
complained of by shepherds in charge of upland hirsels. As we write,
however, there is appearance of rain, which cannot fail to be attended
by a change of wind to a more genial <i>airt</i>, and it is hoped it
may fall abundantly. The summer, by the way, is likely to be a hot and
dry one, if there be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186"
name="pb186">186</a>]</span>any truth in the popular belief that when
the oak takes precedence of the ash in presenting its rich green
foliage to the light, a cloudless, rainless summer is sure to follow.
We observe that everywhere the oak is now in leaf, while the ash is yet
budless and bare to its topmost bough, manifesting an unwonted dulness
and drowsiness for mid-May, as if it was loth, even at the call of
summer, to be roused from its hybernal repose.</p>
<p>We are indebted to the monks of the middle ages for the introduction
into our country, and successful cultivation, of some of our choicest
fruits and most beautiful flowers; nor is it any wonder that in times
when herbalism and the culling of simples was universally practised and
believed in, numberless shrubs and plants of real or supposed efficacy
in the cure of particular ailments should also be imported and
assiduously cultivated by the same benefactors. In some cases, however,
the supposed plants of virtue then introduced have in our day turned
out to be no better than noisome weeds, extremely difficult of
eradication, and one of these&mdash;how it found its way into this
district it would be difficulty to say&mdash;is becoming a perfect pest
in some parts of Lochaber. We refer to the plant commonly known as
<i>Bishopweed</i>, <i>Goatweed</i>, or <i>Herb Gerard</i>, which the
botanists have honoured by the high-sounding name <i lang=
"la">&AElig;gropodium podagraria</i>. Gout, as its botanical name
implies, was the disease in which this rank and foul-smelling weed was
supposed to be of extraordinary virtue, and for anything we know to the
contrary, it may still possess all the virtues at one time so
confidently ascribed to it; but then you see gout is altogether unknown
in Lochaber&mdash;we are too poor, and perforce live too soberly, to be
visited by such aristocratic ailments&mdash;and what business therefore
this weed has to grow and spread amongst us, and become unto us a
nuisance and a plague, we cannot imagine: not knowing the disease, we
could get on very well without the unsavoury antidote. Bishopweed, if
allowed free growth in suitable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>soil, will quickly cover the
ground, to the destruction of everything else, its innumerable stalks,
crowned with pinnated ash-like leaves, attaining to the height of a
foot or more. When a single plant once gets root-hold in pasture land,
it spreads with amazing rapidity, damaging and crowding out the grass
in all directions, so that whenever and wherever it appears its utter
and thorough extirpation, whatever the labour and cost, should be
insisted upon with the least possible delay. When plucked by the hand
the plant emits a f&oelig;tid, sickening smell, all trace of which is
only effaced from the fingers by a very thorough washing indeed. We
have observed that neither horse, nor ox, nor sheep will of choice
touch it, though its being in many places called goatweed would seem to
indicate that it is no more rejected by that animal than many other
acrid and poisonous plants and herbs which our other ruminants will not
touch even if starving. Of all the ground pests with which we are
acquainted, bishopweed is the worst, and we warn our readers, if ever
they meet with it in any neglected corner of garden or field, to show
it no mercy at all, for it is of an unmerciful nature itself, killing
every blade of grass it comes in contact with, and choking unto the
death every other vegetable that it can surmount and master.</p>
<p>The finest stag&rsquo;s head and antlers that we have ever seen form
a trophy in the possession of our neighbour, Mr. Bill, Kilmalieu, the
magnificent &ldquo;monarch of the waste&rdquo; that bore them having
fallen to that gentleman&rsquo;s own rifle in Glengour two or three
years ago. The other day, however, we were shown a set of larger horns,
though not quite so handsome perhaps, or so faultless in spread and
curve, and unfortunately imperfect from the loss of one of the tines,
which was picked up by a shepherd in the Black Mount Forest many years
ago. The size of beam throughout was something extraordinary, and one
could not help regretting that it had not the head and neck attached,
that it might be set up in the style for which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>the
good city of Inverness has of recent years become so famous. Such a
trophy of the chase, complete in all its parts, would have deserved the
place of honour amid a thousand such trophies in the noblest hall in
the kingdom. As we handled these antlers, and poised them at
arm&rsquo;s length with admiration, the thought suddenly struck us that
Edmund Waller, the poet, must have had some such magnificent trophy
before him when he burst into the following apostrophe, in which a
well-known fact in the natural history of the animal is so happily
interwoven with the old mythological legend:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O fertile head! which every year</p>
<p class="line">Could such a crop of wonder bear!</p>
<p class="line">The teeming earth did never bring</p>

<p class="line">Which, might it never have been cast,</p>

<p class="line">Heaven with these engines had been scal&rsquo;d</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Lines, by the way, that would form a most happy and
appropriate inscription for any really fine trophy of this kind.</p>
<p>Calling upon the Misses Macdonald of Achtriachtan the other day at
Fort-William, we were shown some very fine old silver-plate, having a
history of its own, to the recital of which we listened with no small
interest. After the battle of Culloden, a party of
&ldquo;red-coat&rdquo; soldiers entered Lochaber, and employed
themselves in pillaging and plundering in all directions. Hearing that
visitors so unwelcome were in the neighbourhood, Mrs. Cameron of
Glenevis, a lady of great spirit and decision of character, had all her
silver-plate, china, and other valuables buried deep in the ground
outside the garden wall, after which she removed, with her children and
personal attendants, to a spacious cave called <i lang="gd">Uaimh
Shomhairle</i> (Samuel&rsquo;s Cave), far up the glen, in the
south-western shoulder of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>Ben Nevis. Meanwhile the soldiers
visited Glenevis House, but, disappointed at not finding the valuables
they looked for in such a residence, they burned and plundered the glen
without mercy, the terrified inhabitants taking to the mountains, only
too glad to escape with their lives, while their homesteads were in
flames, and their cattle either driven away or slaughtered on the spot.
Lady Glenevis was at last discovered in her cave by a party of
soldiers, who had somehow heard of her place of retreat, and had to
undergo much rude treatment at their hands, because, in defiance of all
their threats, she refused to tell where the valuables of which they
were in search had been hidden away. As they were about to leave the
cave, one of the soldiers, observing that she had something bulky in
her breast, of which she seemed very careful, and over which her plaid,
fastened with a silver brooch, was carefully drawn, made a snatch at
the trinket, and, when the lady resisted, drew his sword and made a
thrust, which cut open the plaid at its point of fastening, wounding
her infant son at the same moment in the neck; for the hidden treasure
in her bosom, though the soldier doubtless thought it might turn out to
be something of more marketable value, was a child only a few months
old. The soldiers at last departed, carrying with them the brooch and
plaid as the only trophies of their victory over the defenceless lady
of the cave. The wounded child recovered, though he bore the mark of
the sword-thrust to his dying day. He lived to be laird of Glenevis,
was father of the late much-respected Mrs. Macdonald of Achtriachtan,
and grandfather of the ladies above mentioned. We remember hearing our
friend, the late Dr. Macintyre of Kilmonivaig, repeating some very fine
Gaelic lines to a waterfall, something in the style of Southey&rsquo;s
address to <i>Lodore</i>, which he said was by the Mrs. Cameron of
Glenevis above mentioned, and composed by her while in hiding in the
cave. When quieter times came round, the buried valuables were of
course exhumed, and were found to be none the worse of their temporary
interment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=

<p>Most birds are endowed with considerable powers of mimicry, the
exercise of which, under favourable circumstances, seems, we have
observed, to afford them great delight. The bird most celebrated in
this respect is, perhaps, the mocking-thrush of America, the singularly
expressive and appropriate name of which, among the Mexican aborigines,
is <i>Cencontlatlolli</i>, which means <i>four hundred tongues or
languages</i>, conferred upon it in honour and acknowledgment of the
fact that, with a rich and varied song of its own, it correctly
imitates all other songs and sounds as well. Though we have nothing
equal to the four-hundred-tongued wonder of America, many of our native
British birds are in truth excellent mimics, particularly after they
have been some time in confinement, the tedium and irksomeness of their
imprisonment being probably alleviated by a constant exercise of their
gifts in this way, until individuals sometimes attain to a mastery in
the art that is perfectly astonishing. Amongst our pets at present is a
goldfinch cock, a very fine bird, still perfect at all points, though
he must be at least a dozen years old, during ten of which he has been
in our possession as a favourite cage-bird. He is a magnificent singer,
and the wisest little fellow in the world; you only wonder, indeed, how
such a rich flood of song, clear and long sustained, can issue from
such a tiny throat, and how such a little scarlet-capped head can
contain so much intelligence and sagacity.
&ldquo;Cowie&rdquo;&mdash;for so he is called, after the bird-catcher
from whom we purchased him&mdash;is above all things an extraordinary
mimic. We have never, indeed, known any bird to equal him in this
respect. The chirping of the sparrow in the hedge opposite the window
at which usually hangs his cage; the twittering of swallows, as they
flit past on their zigzag insect cruise; the <i>fink, fink</i> of the
lively chaffinch; the <i>chirr</i> of the ox-eye tit; the bell-like
jingle of the blackbird scolding a prowling cat; the lugubrious notes
of the corn bunting&rsquo;s evening plaint; the love-cheep of the
lesser white-throat; and the quick rasping utterances <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>of
the excited wren, into whose proper territories a rival has dared to
intrude;&mdash;these are each and all imitated by our little pet with
marvellous exactness of note, emphasis, and tone. The querulous
cheeping of a chicken that has met with some little accident, or for
the moment lost sight of its mother, he mimics to the life; and he will
on such occasions stand on tip-toe, stretch his neck to the utmost, or
cling parrot-like to the topmost wire of his cage, in order to catch a
glimpse of the victim of his ridicule. When tired of this, the commoner
and coarser part of his art, he will burst suddenly into song, which he
will continue sometimes for an hour on end, introducing voluntaries and
variations without number, in which you can readily distinguish longer
or shorter strophes from the songs of almost all the birds he has ever
had a chance of hearing. Any one, indeed, thoroughly familiar with
bird-music could easily name the principal songsters in the district
immediately around us solely from the singing of our talented little
polyglot, so faultless is his imitation of the songs as well as
&ldquo;conversational utterances,&rdquo; so to speak, of all such birds
as he is in the habit of hearing and seeing from his cage at the
frequently open window. You may be sure that &ldquo;Cowie&rdquo; is an
immense favourite with us all, and that his weight in diamonds would
hardly induce us to part with him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192"

Weather changes&mdash;The Carline Thistle&mdash;Burns&mdash;The true
<i lang="la">Carduus Scotticus</i>&mdash;The old Dog-Rhyme.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of no place in existence, perhaps, is the old adage,
in its most literal sense, truer than of Lochaber, that &ldquo;it never
rains but it pours&rdquo; [June 1872]. When we last wrote rain was much
needed; no mid-March could be dustier or colder than was our mid-May;
rain, rain was the cry on all hands; the birds, as they alighted on the
branches or flew overhead, cheeped it querulously; the ducks quacked it
energetically; the hens cackled and gaped for it; while the cattle
afield lowed for it in a manner the meaning of which there was no
mistaking; and at last the change of weather, so universally wished
for, came&mdash;came first of all in the shape of hail, the <i lang=
"la">dira grando</i> of Horace, the downright pea-size genuine article,
which left the hills around as white as if, in questionable taste, they
had whitewashed themselves for the season. <i>Hail!</i> fellow, well
met, was the natural and appropriate greeting. Then came sleet, a
milder form of the same visitation, not very pleasant, perhaps, but we
were grateful; then with the wind from the west, soft and pleasant as
the breath of a child, came warm, genial summer rain; the tiniest blade
of grass felt the benign influence, and, in the beautiful language of
oriental imagery, &ldquo;the mountains and the hills broke forth before
us into singing, and the trees and fields clapped their hands.&rdquo;
It is now mild and beautiful exceedingly, with just enough of rain from
time to time to keep everything fresh and green, and at full stretch of
growth, so that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193"
name="pb193">193</a>]</span>crops of all kinds are everywhere making
the most satisfactory progress; and although the unseasonable hail and
intense cold of ten days ago was very trying to the young potato plants
in exposed situations, we are glad to say that no serious damage has
resulted, the change from cold to milder weather having been very
gradual. The damage in such cases always depends on the suddenness, or
the contrary, of the transition from a low to a high temperature; a
night of frost, followed by a hot sun next day, being most dangerous to
vegetable life, while frost, followed by rain and cloud, and so on
gradually to heat and sunshine again, rarely does any more harm than
merely to give a slight check to what might otherwise prove an
unhealthy rapidity of growth. In the same way it is found that in the
case of animals generally, and in man particularly, it is not the
actual and immediate amount of cold undergone at any time that kills or
maims, but the too sudden transition from a very low temperature to a
comparatively high one. It is probably well enough known to the reader
that very many of our flowers and plants are hygrometric, some of them
very sensitively so. By hygrometric we mean that they spread out or
expand their parts when the sun is bright and the weather is dry, while
they contract or close them on the approach of moisture and cloud. We
would at present draw attention to the fact that the potato plant, in
its earlier stages of growth, is very sensitive in this respect, more
so in some years than in others perhaps, according as the plants have
come up, strong and vigorous and healthy, or the reverse; for we think
our observations during many years warrant us in saying that the more
vigorous and healthier the plant, the more sensitive will it be found
to weather changes&mdash;its very sensitiveness in this respect,
observe, helping forward its growth and preserving its vitality, by
enabling it to avail itself of every favourable influence, just as it
enables it to protect itself against such influences as are
unfavourable or adverse. We were particularly struck with this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>hygrometric sensitiveness in the potato plant a
day or two ago. We have an early planted field, more forward, perhaps,
than anything else of the kind in the West Highlands, over which we
took a friend who happened to call upon us. It was about mid-day, with
a bright, hot sun overhead, and our friend agreed with us that he had
never seen potatoes that had come up more regularly, or that looked
more healthy and vigorous at the same stage of growth, the fully
expanded plants already showing leaves broad and beautiful as those of
a hazel tree in June. In an hour or two afterwards we had occasion to
pass the same field, and the change in the appearance of the plants was
extraordinary. They seemed to have actually grown a couple of inches
since mid-day, and our friend exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, your potatoes are
wonderful! look at them now.&rdquo; And we did look, not so much,
however, at the potato field as our friend did; <i>we</i> looked
upwards and saw that clouds were rapidly forming in the west, one
black, finger-like stripe of which had already nearly mounted to the
zenith, and looking at <i>that</i> and at our potato field, we assured
our friend that a heavy fall of rain, with possibly a gale of wind, was
at hand. Our companion was astonished; the sun was yet shining
brightly, and the greater part of the heavens was clear and cloudless;
but within little more than an hour afterwards the rain fell in
torrents, and a smart gale from the south-west was blowing. Our
potatoes, however, had foreseen it all; were sensible of its approach,
while our friend and ourselves thought ourselves in the midst of fine
weather that might, perhaps, last unbroken for days; and what struck
our companion as a sudden and mysterious addition to the height of the
plants was merely the effect of their having gathered themselves
together&mdash;contracted all their parts into the least possible
compass&mdash;thus assuming an upright pyramidal form, as best enabling
them to withstand the assaults of the approaching storm. Plants of less
health and vigour would, according to our theory, have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>shown the same sensitiveness in the
circumstances, but in a manner not so immediate, and to a degree less
marked and striking. Our companion of that day, who got a thorough
<i>drouking</i>, as we say in Scotland, on his way home that afternoon,
writes us with some humour that &ldquo;as he has always had a great
regard for potatoes on the table, both mashed and &lsquo;balled,&rsquo;
in their &lsquo;jackets,&rsquo; so in future will he, in acknowledgment
of their infallibility in the matter of weather changes, view them with
respect even in the field.&rdquo; It should be stated, by the way, that
this hygrometrical property in the potato plant rapidly diminishes in
sensitiveness as the haulm increases in height and strength, as if it
felt that when approaching its full growth it could afford very much to
disregard such weather changes as are incident to the mid-summer
season; but the reader who has the opportunity may verify all we have
said upon the subject for himself.</p>
<p>Another plant still more remarkable for hygrometric properties is
the common carline, or carlen thistle, the <i lang="la">Carlina
vulgaris</i> of botanists. It is common enough in some districts of
Scotland, though those who do not know it already need not be in the
least ambitious of the honour of its acquaintance, unless indeed from a
purely scientific point of view, for the carline, wherever it appears,
is almost always the infallible sign of a poor soil, miserably farmed.
The species receives its name of <i lang="la">Carlina</i> from an old
story that Charlemagne introduced it into Europe on account of some
valuable medicinal qualities attributed to it; its virtues in this
respect having been revealed, it was said, to Carolus Magnus by an
angel in a vision of the night during the prevalence of a deadly
plague. Certain preparations of its roots and leaves were for centuries
afterwards held of great virtue in such internal complaints as demanded
violent purgatives for their removal; and to this day it is, we
believe, held in great repute by herbalists for the cure of vertigo,
headache, and other cerebral diseases. As a weather prognosticator,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>it is perhaps unequalled by any other British
plant, the sensitiveness of its involucral scales to the slightest
weather changes being so extraordinary as to have from very early times
attracted the attention and aroused the wonderment of those
unacquainted with the fact that similar properties, in a greater or
less degree, are common to all plants and flowers&mdash;to the whole
vegetable kingdom indeed. The carline has a stem of some eight or ten
inches in height, and bears many pretty purple flowerets set in the
midst of straw-coloured rays. The carline&rsquo;s sensitiveness to
weather changes continues long after it has been cut or pulled,
provided the heads have not been much hurt or bruised in the process;
on the same principle, we suppose, that some animals are known to
manifest unmistakeable signs of muscular irritability long after they
are otherwise, as we should say, to all intents and purposes dead. We
have generally met with the carline thistle among sickly-growing oats,
on poor, thin soil, and sometimes among other luxuriant weeds in a
neglected potato field. It is amusing, by the way, sometimes to see
bonnet-badges and pictorial representations of what you are supposed to
believe is the Scottish thistle, evidently copied to the life from one
of the carline family! which are but pigmies in stature and absolutely
harmless in the matter of prickliness compared with the grand stately
fellow bristling with prickles strong as darning needles, and sharp and
venomous as the sting of a bee, with &ldquo;<i lang="la">Nemo me impune
lacessit</i>&rdquo; in the very look of him&mdash;the true national
emblem! You remember Burns&rsquo; reference to it in a very fine stanza

<p>An anonymous lady correspondent in London sent us a manuscript sheet
of paper of the last century, containing a very old dog-rhyme.
&ldquo;The paper has been in our family as long as I can remember, and
I have heard my grandfather repeat the lines often before we left the
Highlands fifty years ago. The Ronald Mac Ronald Vic John mentioned in
the rhyme was, I believe, one of the Glencoe family, a celebrated
hunter of deer in his day. He was killed, as I have heard my
grandfather relate, at the battle of Philiphaugh. It was the fairy
dog-rhyme in one of your recent letters that brought to my mind that
such a thing was in my possession.&rdquo; Owing to the faded state of
the writing, and a very peculiar orthography, we had some difficulty in
deciphering the lines; but, modernising the spelling a little, the
following we believe to be an accurate transcript:&mdash;</p>

Pains&mdash;Old Gaelic Incantation for Cattle Ailments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The best thing, perhaps, that can be said of our
summer up to this date [July 1872], is that it has, upon the whole,
been amiable and summer-like; has, after the manner of a love-lorn
maiden, wept much and often smiled, although, until within the last day
or two, it has never actually laughed. You loved it, and couldn&rsquo;t
help yourself, but your love wanted warmth and fervour, just because of
<i>its</i> want of jocundity and joyousness. Even in our climate,
summer is not summer by the mere reading of the thermometer, however
sensitive and delicate its mercurial indications; one wants brilliant
sunshine, with cloudless, or almost cloudless skies, to make up a
summer as a summer proper ought to be. The poets of the East and South
always speak of summer and summer scenes as &ldquo;laughing,&rdquo;
while in more northern and less favoured lands your poet is content to
describe otherwise exactly similar scenes and situations as simply
&ldquo;smiling,&rdquo; &ldquo;gentle,&rdquo; &ldquo;sweet,&rdquo;
&ldquo;quiet,&rdquo; and so forth, so that an acute critic, by
attending to this alone, could tell, were other proofs entirely
wanting, whether a poet was born under northern skies, or lived and
loved, soared and sang, in sunnier and more southern climes. Horace
has&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&mdash;&ldquo;<i>mihi angulus ridet</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">His &ldquo;corner,&rdquo; observe, does not merely
smile; it &ldquo;<i>laughs</i>&rdquo; under the bright blue Italian
sky. Lucretius has&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&mdash;&ldquo;<i>tibi rident &aelig;quora
ponti</i>;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>which Creech and Dryden, bards of a colder clime, have rendered
&ldquo;smiles,&rdquo; but which literally and truly is honest, open,
joyous &ldquo;<i>laughter</i>&rdquo; in the southern bard. Metaetasio
has&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;A te fioriscono</p>

</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i lang="it">Ridono</i>,&rdquo;
observe&mdash;laughter again&mdash;like his earlier countrymen, Horace
and Lucretius. Our British poets rarely venture to make spring or
summer do more than smile; they are afraid of the laughter of the
south, as being <i lang="la">quoad hoc</i> an over-bold hyperbole. We
can only quote at this moment two instances in which the laughter of
more favoured lands is boldly introduced. John Langhorne, a poet and
miscellaneous writer of the last century, author of the <i>Fables of
Flora</i>, very beautifully says&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Where Tweed&rsquo;s soft banks in liberal beauty
lie,</p>
<p class="line">And Flora <i>laughs</i> beneath an azure
sky.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And Chaucer, the father of English poetry, has the
following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The busy lark&euml;, messager of daye,</p>
<p class="line">Salueth in hire song the morwe gray;</p>
<p class="line">And fyry Phebus ryseth up so brighte,</p>
<p class="line">That al the orient <i>laugheth</i> of the
light.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Very finely modernised by Dryden thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The morning lark, messenger of day,</p>
<p class="line">Saluted in her song the morning grey;</p>
<p class="line">And soon the sun arose with beams so bright</p>
<p class="line"><i>That all the horizon laughed</i> to see the joyous
sight.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Our summer, then, thus far, has not been a
&ldquo;laughing,&rdquo; but, at the best, a merely smiling summer.
There has been but little actual sunshine, rarely such a thing as a
blue, unclouded sky; but, if we do not err, if the wish be not
altogether father to the thought, a splendid autumn, glad and
golden&mdash;summer and autumn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>in one, like the companion
scenes in a stereoscope, in close and kindly combination&mdash;is in
store for us. Even as it is, the country is very beautiful, and the
rains of the west, if superabundant, are at least perfectly harmless to
any one in ordinary health, no matter how often you get drenched
through and through, as the saying is, provided always you do not idly
saunter or sit down for any length of time in wet clothes; neglect this
precaution, however, and you may look out for an attack of rheumatism,
and the taste of pains to which the tortures of the rack were but a
joke&mdash;pains as fiery and intense as those threatened against the
foul-mouthed Caliban in the <i>Tempest</i>. You recollect what Prospero
says&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Hag-seed hence!</p>
<p class="line">Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou wert best</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Get wet, then, as often and as much as you like, in
the West Highlands, but don&rsquo;t sit down or idle about in wet
clothes, is a friend&rsquo;s advice; otherwise, you will soon have a
pretty correct idea of the nature of the cramps and aches of which even
the brutal Caliban had such a horror that he exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">Supplementary to our last paper on the spells and
incantations of the Highlands, the following has been sent to us by our
kind correspondent, Mr. Carmichael, of the Inland Revenue, Island of
Uist, a gentleman of whom highly honourable mention is made in Mr.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A fortnight&rsquo;s incessant rain [September
1872]&mdash;rain descending at times in solid sheets&mdash;not only
wets the ground and puddles the roads, but makes one&rsquo;s very
brains feel soft and sloppy and mashed-turnip-wise. You take up a book
only to lay it down again. You fill your pipe and set it alight, but
with less than half a dozen whiffs you are more than satiated. The weed
has lost its flavour. You sit down to write &ldquo;doggedly,&rdquo; as
Johnson says, but with all your doggedness the pen totters over the
sheet with pace uncertain and listless, as if even he felt disinclined
for the task, and the sentences, like a squad of raw recruits, refuse
to fall gracefully into their places, and stumble against each other in
ludicrous confusion, to the consternation and grief of the most patient
of drill-sergeants. You will not, perhaps, believe it, but it is true,
nevertheless, that so persistent, penetrating, and inter-penetrating
has been the last fortnight&rsquo;s rain, that in nineteen cases out of
twenty a lucifer match, &ldquo;vesuvian,&rdquo; or fusee will
obstinately refuse to ignite by any other process than putting it into
actual contact with fire, and in that case, why, a slip of paper is
just as easily dealt with, as well as more efficacious for your
purpose. Hay and corn luckily stand a good deal of rain without being
completely spoiled, but we are afraid to estimate the amount of damage
that another week&rsquo;s wet weather will cause over the West
Highlands. All our own hay and corn has been snugly housed more than
three weeks ago. Why <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"
name="pb205">205</a>]</span>shouldn&rsquo;t everybody sow in February
or early March as we do, and have their ingathering in August,
generally our best and driest month? In a climate so treacherous and
inconstant as ours is, it is the greatest folly in the world to run the
smallest risk that you can possibly avoid. We have been preaching this
particular doctrine for a dozen years past, and it has had some effect
in our immediate neighbourhood; but it is sad to see the country at
large at this moment&mdash;corn and hay rotting in the fields, that
might, with ordinary prudence and a little effort, be long ere now snug
and safe under &ldquo;thack and rape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more one inquires the truer does he find the dictum of a
philosopher of the last century to be, that &ldquo;the superstitions,
as well as the languages, of all lands and ages are linked together by
mysterious bonds, which neither time nor distance seem able to
destroy.&rdquo; In our immediate neighbourhood an instance of a very
old superstition was brought under our notice a few days ago, such as,
with all our knowledge of such matters, we had hitherto never dreamt of
as existing in the Western Highlands. A man went to market at a
considerable distance to sell a good strong two-year-old colt. He did
not return on the day his wife expected him, and she became uneasy, not
so much for the well-being of her laggard liege lord and
master&mdash;<i>he</i> had often gone the same errand before, and had
always returned safe and sound, even if a little later than his better
half had a right to expect&mdash;but as to whether he had sold the
colt, and if for anything like the price settled between the twain as
being his fair price before he left home. She put on a large fire on
her hearth, placing, when it had reached a certain stage of ignition, a
bundle of green alder boughs atop. When the whole was fully ablaze, she
went outside and watched the direction of the smoke issuing from her
chimney. The smoke was carried in an easterly direction, a lucky
quarter, and she returned to the house and told her daughter that,
whatever had come over the father&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>and she threatened to
tell him a bit of her mind as to his doings on his return&mdash;the
colt at least had been sold, and well sold, for the alder smoke had
gone in the best and luckiest of all directions, towards the east, in
the direction of the rising sun; and she had never known the omen fail.
The curious thing is that within an hour or so on that very evening the
man returned, and counted into his wife&rsquo;s lap two pounds and four
shillings sterling over and above the expected price of the colt, as
agreed upon at home. The only other curious thing that we could gather
in connection with the superstition is that the alder branches must be
cut specially for the occasion, and by a virgin. It was so in this
case; and we are gravely assured that, if it had been otherwise, the
ascending smoke would either have drifted hither and thither without a
purpose, unsteadily, or have uselessly intermingled with that of the
neighbouring cottages. The superstition, you must know, is a very old
one; the Greeks and Romans practised it, and from them it spread widely
over the European Continent. In books on magic and divination it is
called <i>Capnomancy</i>, derived, as our friend Professor Blackie
could tell you better than anybody else, from the Greek <i>Capnos</i>,
smoke, and <i>manteia</i>, divination, witchcraft. The ancients paid
attention principally to the smoke of sacrifices, as well as to the
briskness with which the fire burned. If the smoke ascended in a
straight columnar body zenithwards, it was a favourable omen; if it was
violently blown aside, or fell back over the altar and the sacrificers,
it was of evil augury. Our Highland dame&rsquo;s notion of its taking
an easterly course, towards the direction of the breaking day, of the
dawn, and the morning sun, seems to us full of a rough and rude poetry
such as you frequently meet with in carefully examining into the
details of even the grossest superstitions. Having had occasion to be
of some little service to the priestess in this rare act of divination,
we had the whole from her own lips, though she was averse at first, as
is generally the case when a clergyman is the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>inquirer, to entering upon the subject at all.
How these practices root themselves among a people, defying
eradication, is very extraordinary.</p>
<p>Did you ever, reader, crack a nut? Not the aristocratic walnut or
filbert over your wine, but the far superior, rich, ripe hazel nut in
its season from off the hazel bough, when the bright autumnal sun was
overhead, and the autumnal breeze stirred the leaves around you, their
multitudinous murmur resembling the far-heard music of the restless
sea. A ripe hazel nut is good anywhere, but best of all when gathered
by your own hand in its native wild wood from the overhanging branch,
whence the beautiful cluster nods at you as if soliciting your
attention, now and again, as you approach to pull it, seeming to
delight in playing a game of bo-peep with you among the leaves, like as
you have seen the Pleiades at times when, though the night be clear,
many blanket-like clouds are chasing each other in wild career athwart
the starry blue. Throughout the whole range of poetry, the hazel nut,
though often mentioned, has never perhaps had so much justice done to
it as by the Gaelic bard Duncan B&agrave;n Macintyre. In his <i lang=

<p class="first">Our nuts are unusually plentiful this year, and of a
size and flavour that we do not recollect ever to have seen equalled.
They are now at that stage of ripeness when they are most delicious to
the taste, and one may indulge in any amount of them with perfect
safety. Most people are fond of nuts, but if the reader wants to enjoy
the full flavour, to get out of a nut all that is in it, let him take
the following recipe:&mdash;&ldquo;First of all, let the nut be
cracked, if possible, between your own <i>molars</i>, for these are,
after all, the first and most natural and best of all nut-crackers,
better <i lang="la">quoad hoc</i> than an instrument of the purest
silver or steel; and there is besides, remember, something pleasant to
the palate in the feel and flavour even of an uncracked nut. Having
cracked your nut, then&mdash;and fairly placed between the grinders, a
really good nut is not difficult to crack, the worst nuts being always
the most difficult to deal with, for the more insignificant the kernel
the thicker and <i>dourer</i> the shell&mdash;having cracked your nut
and extracted the kernel, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span><i>whole</i> if possible,
introduce it into your mouth, not <i>per se</i>, by itself, as is
commonly done, but with a small fragment of the shell,&mdash;a bit of
pin&rsquo;s head size will do. Proceed now to masticate the delicious
morsel, and confess that there is a delicacy and flavour about a hazel
nut that you knew not how to extract in full, although in your day you
had cracked your bushels of them, until you were taught it from Nether
Lochaber. The philosophy of the thing is that the particle of shell
introduced with the kernel causes the act of mastication to be
performed more thoroughly than it otherwise would be, setting free the
full flavour and aroma&mdash;all, in short, that a nut has to give.

</div>
<p class="first">Take an example of something wonderful in insect life,
as it chanced to come under our notice a few days ago [September 1872].
We were raking hay&mdash;raking hay, too, after others had raked the
same ground shortly before us, for we are most particular that, both
for the look of the thing, as well as for the profit, not a wisp, not a
strawlet shall be left upon the ground&mdash;when, as we raked, we came
across a dead mole. No rare or wonderful thing, the reader may exclaim,
but rare enough when you come to think of it, and wonderful enough,
too, to attract the attention of any one even less observant of natural
history than Nether Lochaber. Lying on its side was the mole, already
half-hidden by the swiftly growing aftermath. Touching it with the
corner of our rake, and moving it slightly, we got a glimpse of a
yellow-banded beetle busy underneath; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>at once understanding
what was going on, we called our <i>bairns</i>, a couple of girls and a
boy, who were raking and laughing <i lang="fr">a la Madame de
S&eacute;vign&eacute;</i> in the field beside us, to give them a lesson
on entomology; and as our lesson was fresh and to the point, and
interesting, though we say it ourselves, and rather out of the common
track of entomological experience, we give it to the reader, that he
may know and believe, and reverently ponder, a truth that has never
been so well expressed as by St. Augustine, the sturdy, old, bellicose
Bishop of Hippo, who of all the Fathers had the most sensitive nose for
the out-ferreting of a heretic, and who, when he got hold of one,
treated him very much as a Scotch terrier does a rat&mdash;but who
could say and do good things notwithstanding. <i lang="la">Deus magnus
in magnis, maximus in minimis.</i> God is great, that is, in great
things, but greatest of all in least things. The mole, as we have said,
was lying on his side on a grassy patch of fast-growing aftermath, and
our glimpse of the beetle beneath showed us that it was the <i lang=
"la">Necrophorus vespillo</i>, or burying-beetle, rare anywhere in
Britain, and so rare in Lochaber and the west coast, that this was only
the third or fourth instance in which we had met with it. It is a black
beetle, rather more than an inch in length, with two bright
orange-coloured bands across the back, and more active in all its
movements than any of its congeners. There were just two beetles,
observe&mdash;a pair, male and female&mdash;engaged upon the mole, and
the &ldquo;mole&rdquo; of Adrianus, when a-building, showed not more
labour and not half the mechanical skill or indomitable perseverance on
the part of its constructors exhibited by these tiny but thoroughly
skilled excavators in the case of <i>their</i> mole. &ldquo;You see
that mole,&rdquo; we said to our attentive audience, leaning upon our
rake for the moment, as if it were a sceptre of prerogative and power,
as in truth it was. &ldquo;It is almost as big as an ordinary sized
rat&mdash;bigger, you will confess, than three full-grown mice. It has
only been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>dead, say, a dozen of hours; his sleek and still
glossy coat proves it. This pair of beetles, then, a single pair
remember, have discovered him by an instinct and sense of smell which
must be wonderfully delicate and keen. They are now, as you may see,
busy digging under and around him, and after breakfast to-morrow
morning we shall come and see the result.<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5614" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> &ldquo;Suppose,
papa,&rdquo; said one of the girls, with a demure look, though with a
merry twinkle in her eye the while, &ldquo;Suppose, sir, that this
afternoon a passing kestrel or owl should pick up our mole and make a
meal of him, what then could we see in the morning?&rdquo; &ldquo;What
you suggest is, no doubt, possible enough,&rdquo; was our rejoinder,
&ldquo;but we believe the mole will be here to-morrow morning all the
same, provided you take example from the animal&rsquo;s proverbial
wakefulness, and are up and have breakfast ready for us all in good
time.&rdquo; Meantime, that they might know it again, should they ever
come across it, we took up the male beetle, distinguishing the sex from
his being somewhat smaller and rather more active than his mate, on the
palm of our left hand, and with the fingers of the right turned him on
his back to show him properly, the delicate markings of his abdomen,
his muscular thorax and <i>cas-chrom</i> shaped antenn&aelig;. We soon
wished we had not done it; it was a thoughtless proceeding on our part,
and we should have known better. We nearly fainted, and our children
started back in horror and alarm at the foul and f&oelig;tid smell of
the carrion-eating <i lang="la">Vespillo</i>. It was horrible; never in
all our experience were our olfactory nerves so offended. A pot of
stale assaf&oelig;tida from a druggist&rsquo;s shop, all the proverbial
many dozen stinks of Cologne in combination, would have been a joke to
it, a bouquet of roses compared with our <i lang="la">Vespillo</i>. It
made us quite sick and ill for the moment; but we had the presence of
mind to lay down our malodorous beetle beside his beloved mole ere we
followed our audience, who were by this time scampering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>in
all directions across the field, with their fingers tightly compressing
their nostrils, and vowing that they would have no more to do with dead
moles or burying-beetles, be they ever so brightly banded or
interesting from papa&rsquo;s point of view. A message now came forth
that tea was ready; but no tea could we drink, nor bread could we
handle, on account of the horrible smell that still adhered to our
fingers and palm. Washing with soap and water had no effect upon it,
for it seemed to have instantly and thoroughly penetrated and permeated
skin, flesh, and muscle, and to have reached and lodged in the very
bone itself, whence it refused to be extirpated. It was only late at
night, sitting by a briny rock-pool, and using the viscous clay of the
beach after the manner of soap, that we managed to get quit of the foul
odour; and even after a final washing with hot water and scented soap,
as we retired for the night, we still persuaded ourselves that the
loathsome smell had not altogether departed. All the carrion beetles,
without exception, and most of the ground beetles proper, have always
more or less of a disagreeable, sickening smell about them, but in this
respect the burying-beetle is worse than all the rest put together;
seeming to have centered in his own person a combination of the
essences of all possible stenches in their worst and foulest form. In
the case of the <i lang="la">Vespillo</i>, it is to be noted that the
f&oelig;tid smell, though always there, and easily perceptible, is
bearable enough while the animal is quiescent and undisturbed, and you
do not approach it too closely. Tease it, however, in any way; touch it
with the point of a switch, or take it up, as we foolishly did, in your
hand, and the stench, emitted probably in self-defence, as in the case
of the <i>skunk</i> and polecat, is of all others the most abominable
in itself, and the most difficult to get rid of. Next morning, then, on
visiting the mole, as proposed, we found it completely buried, with at
least half an inch depth of earth neatly shovelled over it, with a
slight ridge in the centre, and sloping <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>sides, showing that
the <i lang="la">Vespillones</i> are practised grave-diggers. Averse to
disturbing a work that had cost the tiny excavators so much labour, we
only removed the earth sufficiently to bring a small patch of the
mole&rsquo;s fur to view, in proof to those accompanying us that the
animal had really been buried by the beetles, as we had said it would
be. A full-grown elephant buried by a pair of field mice would hardly
be a more wonderful labour. The <i>rationale</i> and <i lang=
"fr">raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the whole labour thus carried out
with so much diligence and engineering skill is this: the carrion of
the dead mole, mouse, or bird thus operated upon, serves in the first
instance partly as food for the beetles themselves (and they richly
deserve a feast, such as it is, in reward for their arduous labours),
after which the female lays her eggs in the fast-rotting carcase, and
it is then left as the doubtless savoury banquet of the larv&aelig;,
while the parent pair cruise about in search of another dead bird or
quadruped of the proper size, whereupon to bestow similar attentions.
It is principally owing to the labours of these beetles that it happens
that although you may see a dead mole, mouse, or bird lying in the
corner of a field to-day, you shall look for it in vain next morning
elsewhere than in a beetle-dug grave, as in the above instance. That a
single pair of these comparatively small insects should be able to
perform such a gigantic task in so short a time is, in truth, very
wonderful, and must seem incredible to any one unacquainted with the
habits and economy of the order.</p>
<p>There are doubtless many odd and curious ways of earning even an
honest livelihood in this world, but the oddest, and to us, while
uninitiated, the most puzzling we have met with for a long time, was
the following:&mdash;On a fine day lately, we took our boat to the
mouth of the Coe, and were leisurely proceeding up the far-famed glen,
when we saw, a little before us, a diminutive but still active old man,
whom, from his peculiar style of dress, we had no difficulty in
recognising as a peripatetic vendor of ballads, letter-paper,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>steel pens, and other knick-knacks, who
frequently pays us a visit in Lochaber, and with whom, in lieu of
better company, we have had many a far from uninteresting roadside
crack. As, with a longer and livelier stride than his, we were rapidly
overtaking him, we noticed that he frequently stopped and picked up
something, now from the middle of the road, now from the footpath at
the side, and occasionally from the grass beyond, which something he
instantly deposited in a sort of canvas side-pouch, or wallet slung at
his side. &ldquo;Well, Willie,&rdquo; we exclaimed, as we came up with
him, &ldquo;what in the world are you doing in the glen to-day, and
where&rsquo;s your pack? I wish to have a look at your bundle of
ballads?&rdquo; &ldquo;Weel, sir,&rdquo; was Willie&rsquo;s response,
&ldquo;my pack is laid by at Duror just now; my present
wark&rdquo;&mdash;here he made a dart at something on the grass that
looked to us uncommonly like a big black beetle, and transferred it to
his wallet,&mdash;&ldquo;my present wark,&rdquo; he went on to say,
&ldquo;pays far better, and is mair pleasant, besides, in this
dreadfu&rsquo; hot weather.<a id="xd26e5651" name=
"xd26e5651"></a>&rdquo; &ldquo;But what is your present work,
Willie?&rdquo; we inquired, &ldquo;what are you so industriously
picking up along the road and transferring to your wallet? Snails?
beetles? what?&rdquo; &ldquo;No mony snails, or beetles either,
sir,&rdquo; said Willie, with more entomological good sense than we
gave him credit for, &ldquo;abroad in such hot and dry weather as this
is. I&rsquo;m no very fond of telling what I am doing to everybody; and
when I see anybody coming, I generally sit down and let them pass; but
I saw you coming, sir, and I kent ye brawly, and didn&rsquo;t mind. And
now I&rsquo;ll show ye what I&rsquo;m gathering.&rdquo; With this he
put his hand in his capacious pouch, and took out a handful of <i>cigar
and cheroot stumps</i>, of all shapes and sizes. Some had been
&ldquo;smoked out,&rdquo; that is, till only an inch or so remained;
others were only half smoked, and a few had only afforded the smoker a
whiff or two, when, from a disinclination to smoke any further, or,
perhaps, from some defect in the cigar itself, it was thrown away as of
no further <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>use. Of these cigar stumps &ldquo;Willie&rdquo;
had at that moment nearly a pound weight in his wallet, the result of
his forenoon&rsquo;s labours. We daresay we looked, as we really were,
very much puzzled, which, Willie observing, he politely asked us for a
light for his pipe, and invited us to sit on a ledge of rock by the
roadside, and he would &ldquo;tell us a&rsquo; aboot it.&rdquo; Our
pipes alight, we sat down accordingly, and Willie proceeds as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Weel, sir, I doubt if ever there was such a
number of strangers&mdash;tourists, as they ca&rsquo; them&mdash;day
after day in Glencoe as there are this year. And a&rsquo; the gentlemen
that goes up the glen smoke, and I have seen some of the
ladies&mdash;forrenders, I suspect&mdash;smoking too, the mair shame to
them. They a&rsquo; maistly smoke cigars, and they throw them from them
when they&rsquo;re done with them; sometimes only a short stump, and
sometimes almost a hail ane, as I have shown ye; and I pick them up and
sell them in Greenock or Glasgow for three ha&rsquo;pence or tuppence
the ounce, and that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; aboot it.&rdquo; &ldquo;But
what,&rdquo; we inquired, &ldquo;do they make of them in
Glasgow?&rdquo; &ldquo;Weel, sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I believe
some of them, the cleanest, langest, and best bits, are unrolled, and
made up anew into cigars, and the shorter and dirtier stumps are dried
and broken down to mix with other tobacco, in making the mixtures
called &lsquo;bird&rsquo;s eye,&rsquo; &lsquo;shag,&rsquo; <i>exetry,
exetry</i>.&rdquo; We ordered Willie a glass of beer at Clachaig, and
went on our way with a bit of curious information, till that particular
date undreamt of in all our philosophy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From a utilitarian point of view, at least, the
ancients seem to have looked upon the sea and all its
products&mdash;exclusive, of course, of its myriad inhabitants of finny
tribes&mdash;as absolutely worthless. Homer in the <i>Iliad</i>
constantly speaks of the sea as &ldquo;unfertile,&rdquo;
<i>&#259;l&ograve;s atrug&eacute;toio</i>,&mdash;literally, the ocean
where no harvest can be gathered; and Horace in one of his satires says
that a man may be possessed of all the virtues, and all the
accomplishments, &amp;c. to boot, but if yet <i lang="la">sine
r&ecirc;</i>&mdash;without means, moneyless, or to use, perhaps, the
best equivalent that our language can afford, without
<i>substance</i>&mdash;he shall be accounted &ldquo;<i>vilior
alg&acirc;</i>,&rdquo; viler than seaweed, or, as we should say, viler
than the dust on which he treads. Even Virgil in the <i>Georgics</i>
has no good word for the sea as in any sense, directly or indirectly,
subservient to husbandry, or an ally to the tiller of the ground. Had
these master-poets of Greece and Rome, gentle reader, lived with us
here in Nether Lochaber, in the seventh decade of the nineteenth
century, they would have thought and said differently. Homer would have
probably selected a more appropriate epithet than that constantly
employed by him; Horace would have cast about for some other fitting
dissyllable as a substitute for &ldquo;<i>alg&acirc;</i>;&rdquo; and
Virgil would have written, as he alone could write, a score or two of
unexceptionable hexameters in praise of seaweed as an excellent manure
and fertiliser of the soil. &ldquo;It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>an ill wind,&rdquo;
quoth the proverb, &ldquo;that blows nobody good;&rdquo; and disastrous
in many a place as was the dreadful storm of the first week of this
month [November 1872], here along the western seaboard it only blew us
good, in the very tangible and <i>tangly</i> shape of thousands of tons
of drift-ware, that, laid on the soil in fair abundance just now,
prepares it without any more trouble for the reception of seed, when,
ushered in by the vernal equinox, the jocund, jolly spring comes round.
For the last fortnight, wherever you wandered about the coast, you
found the people in every direction&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;busy as busy could be gathering and carting afield this
really valuable product of the sea&mdash;Homer and Horace to the
contrary notwithstanding. We draw attention to the subject at present
by reason of its timeousness, and because within recent years we have
had it made clear to us beyond all cavil, and in the most practical
manner possible, that for potatoes at least there is no manure for a
moment to be compared with a heavy blanketing of drift-ware laid on the
ground in early winter. On our own land this year a field of potatoes
thus treated was a third at least better than another of equal size
manured from the farmyard &ldquo;heap&rdquo; in the usual orthodox
manner. The soil, observe, was the same, the seed the same, the date of
planting the same&mdash;the only difference being in the manure. In the
experience of such of our neighbours, too, as have tried it, the result
has been precisely the same. The salts and other essential ingredients
of seaware seem to be really antagonistic to the spread of
&ldquo;blight&rdquo; among the tubers; and we would strongly advise as
many of our readers as have the opportunity to experiment for
themselves in the direction indicated during the present winter and
spring, and we are ready to wager our good porcupine-shafted
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; steel pen against the vilest crow-quill, that,
on the ingathering of the crop this time twelve months, our advice, in
nineteen cases out of twenty, will have been found to be a sound and
good one. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=

<p>Since the cessation of the terrible gales of the early part of the
month, the weather has been bright, bracing, and breezy, with
occasional snow showers along the uplands, that have already converted
the many mountain ridges around each into a veritable <i>Sierra
Nevada</i>. On the nights of the 13&ndash;14th and 14&ndash;15th we sat
up till a late, or rather an early hour, keenly on the watch for a
meteoric display, in railway nomenclature, then due, but which, up to
the date of the present writing, has not yet put in an appearance.
Meteors there were, but they were the mere phosphorescent streaks
rarely looked for in vain by the student of the heavens on a fairly
cloudless night at this season. The lunar eclipse of the early morning
of the 15th was well seen, the beautiful orb, like a shield of
burnished silver, riding serene in the unclouded blue; but the
obscuration was too partial to be in any way interesting or striking to
any one who had gazed on the phenomenon in its grander phases as often
as we have done.</p>
<p>To our good friend Mr. Carmichael of South Uist we are indebted for
the following contributions to our stock of ancient Celtic folk-lore, a
subject much neglected, but of very great interest
notwithstanding:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Apart from the appropriateness and almost absolute
faultlessness of the rhythm and language in which they are couched,
nothing about these old Hebridean &ldquo;Blessings&rdquo; seems to us
so beautiful and striking as the nearness with which they bring Heaven
and its active, ceaseless beneficence, to the very firesides and
commonest affairs of men. Nothing is too small or insignificant to be
placed, not in a general way observe, but in the most literal
particular sense, under the Divine guardianship. With these old people,
in their ocean-girt and storm-swept islands, God was not merely the
creator, but the ever present, ever near father, protector, and friend,
while to them His angels were in very truth &ldquo;<i>ministering</i>
spirits, sent forth to <i>minister</i> for them who shall be heirs of
salvation&rdquo;&mdash;not merely in spiritual matters, we are to
remark, but in all the affairs of common, every-day life. Since the
days of the ancient Hebrews, nowhere shall we find so firm and fixed a
belief in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=

for good between Heaven and Earth.</p>

<p class="first">The reference to &ldquo;Luath,&rdquo;
Cuchullin&rsquo;s matchless dog, so celebrated in the Ossianic poems
and old Fingalian tales, is curious. The ghosts of the Fingalian
heroes, existing in a sort of middle state&mdash;not yet exactly saved
nor wholly lost&mdash;with those of their famous dogs, were believed to
visit at times the scenes of their former exploits for the sake of the
hunting, in which they so much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>delighted, and a cow or other
animal, running about excitedly and wildly, and, to all human
investigation, causelessly, was supposed to be the work of a passing
Fingalian hunting party, invisible to mortal eyes, Luath, unmatched in
spirit-land as upon earth, still leading the chase as of old. On the
lines about St. Patrick&rsquo;s dairymaid or milkmaid Mr. Carmichael
has the following note, which will be read with interest, and which we
give in his own words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p lang="gd" class="line">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Banachag Phadriug
mu&rsquo;r casan.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">(St. Patrick&rsquo;s dairymaid be around your
feet.)</p>
</div>
<p class="first"><i>Banachag</i> is the Hebridean form of the
<i>Banarach</i> of the mainland, and <i>Banachogach</i> or
<i>Banacach</i> is the Hebridean term for the smallpox. You will
observe the close resemblance between the Gaelic word for a dairymaid
and that for the smallpox. I think the explanation is obvious.
Dairymaids were wont to get the cow-pox, and people confounded the
cow-pox with the smallpox. Hence, in the Highlands old people will tell
you that effects of the cow-pox were known long before Jenner&rsquo;s
celebrated discovery. Hence, also, you will rarely meet with a woman in
the Highlands disfigured from the effects of smallpox. Not so the men,
however. In England, again, in the rural parishes, the case is
reversed. There you will see women pox-marked, but seldom men. The
reason I take it to be is this:&mdash;In the Highlands it is the woman
who milk the cattle, and in doing so they get the cow-pox off the cows
in milking them. A Highlander would consider it unmanly to milk a cow.
I have never seen or heard of one who could or would do this, except a
young man in Lismore. Three or four young men, brothers, had a small
farm among them. Their mother died and their two sisters married, and
probably remembering Calum-Cille&rsquo;s celebrated saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Man, the hermit, sighed, till woman
smiled.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">One of them ultimately brought home a wife, who soon
became a cause of discord and ill-will among the previously happy and
affectionate brothers. But this is digressing. In England it is the men
who milk the cows. Most men in rural parishes can milk, and but few
women. Consequently in the agricultural districts of England you hardly
ever see an elderly man disfigured by the smallpox, but you can see
many women so disfigured. These suggestions are simply the results of
my own observations in England and in the Highlands. They may be to the
purpose or not, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We think they are to the purpose, and we are very much obliged to
our correspondent for his many interesting contributions from the Outer
Hebrides to our stock of &ldquo;auld-world&rdquo; folk-lore.

<p class="first">In the poetry and proverbs of our country you
constantly meet with references which go to prove that alternations of
sunshine and shower [April 1873] have for ages been held to be the
meteorological characteristics of an April day throughout the British

ebb even in midsummer, while in some places you hear complaints of an
absolute scarcity of water even for ordinary household purposes&mdash;a
very rare thing, indeed, in the West Highlands at this season of the
year, or for that matter of it at any season. There was, however, such
a superabundance of moisture in the ground, from the heavy rains of the
past winter, that vegetation has as yet suffered little or nothing from
the drought, and the country is beautiful exceedingly in all its
greenery of leaf and gaiety of expanding <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

literally as merry as the day is long, for with the first flush of dawn
in the east they begin their rich and varied song, which, with a short
interval of quiescence and repose about mid-day, is continued without
interruption until long after the sun has set and the earlier stars are
already twinkling through the twilight gloom. April will be succeeded
by the &ldquo;merry month of May,&rdquo; which, with the exception of
two, or at most three, cold days, with frost at night, about the 10th,
is pretty sure to be an unusually fine month even for May. It was an
article of belief in the hygienic code of the old Highlanders, and
which you come across occasionally even at the present day, that the
invalid, suffering under no matter what form of internal ailment, upon
whom the sun of May once fairly shed its light, was pretty sure of a
renewed lease of life until at least the next autumnal equinox, and how
fine, by the way, and lightsome and cheery withal, Bishop Gawin

Bishop Douglas&rsquo; <i>&AElig;neid</i>, that &ldquo;it is executed
with equal spirit and fidelity, and is a proof that the Lowland Scotch
and English languages were then nearly the same.&rdquo; We may state
that Douglas&rsquo; <i>&AElig;neid</i>, irrespective of its many and
great intrinsic merits, is especially interesting, as being the first
translation of a Roman classic into the English language either in
verse or prose. We have quoted above an old Highland belief in the
exceeding efficacy, even in the most serious ailments, of the kindly
beams of a May-day sun. Another belief of theirs was this&mdash;</p>

sheep.</p>
<p>A few days ago we went into a cottage where a woman was sitting
spinning, and singing a song we had not heard for many years, though we
recollect hearing it frequently sung in boyhood. The soft and plaintive
air was an old favourite, and her style of singing pleasing. With a
very sweet voice and much feeling, she sang it all on requesting her to
do so; and after tea in the evening we threw the verses into English,
as follows. It is, however, rather an imitation than a translation. The

<p class="first">The moral of our song is obvious, though you will
observe the story is told with all possible delicacy and good taste, a
characteristic, by the way, of our best Gaelic poetry. The reader may
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>easily understand that, sung in proper time and
place, and with proper feeling, such a song is calculated to have a
good effect, and convey a healthy lesson in its own indirect way, when
a sermon or moral exhortation, however well meant, would be altogether
out of the question. There is much sound sense in Mackworth
Praed&rsquo;s <i>Chaunt of the Brazen Head</i>, the first verse of
which is this&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I think, whatever mortals crave</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">With impotent endeavour,</p>
<p class="line">A wreath&mdash;a rank&mdash;a throne&mdash;a
grave&mdash;</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">The world goes round for ever;</p>
<p class="line">I think that life is not too long,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">And, therefore, I determine,</p>
<p class="line"><i>That many people read a song,</i></p>
<p class="line xd26e978"><i>Who will not read a sermon.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At a bridal, baptism, or other merry-making, such a
song as the above is calculated to do more good than the most laboured,
well-meant, and goody-goody sermon that ever was preached. As we rode
away from yonder cottage door, the woman resuming her task, and
chanting a gay and lively air in accompaniment, we were reminded of a
verse quite <i>apropos</i> to the occasion:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Verse sweetens toil, however rude the sound:</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">All at her work the village maiden sings;</p>
<p class="line">Nor while she turns the giddy wheel around,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Revolves the sad vicissitude of
things.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And we also thought of the simple and beautiful
epitaph on the tomb of a nameless Roman matron:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">A discovery of considerable arch&aelig;ological
interest has recently been made by some people employed in trenching
the moss of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>Ballachulish in our neighbourhood. At a depth of
ten feet in the &ldquo;drift&rdquo; subsoil, underlying six or seven
feet of moss, only removed within recent years in the ordinary course
of peat-cutting, was found the remains of what, in the far past, must
have been a flint instrument manufactory on a large scale. Within an
area of twenty or thirty square yards was disclosed several cartloads
of flint chippings, manifestly broken off in the manufacture of flint
instruments, for we have been able to secure several arrow heads, two
roughly finished chisels, and a hammer head of curious shape, with a
hole in the centre, which must have cost the maker no small amount of
time and trouble in the manipulation. What renders this
&ldquo;find&rdquo; more interesting is the fact that the material must
have been brought to the place of manufacture from a considerable
distance, flint being of rare occurrence anywhere in Nether Lochaber.
Underlying such a depth of solid moss and drift, such a discovery
necessarily carries us back to a race of men who lived in a very remote
period indeed; how remote, even geology is as yet unable absolutely to
say. We were unfortunately from home at the time the discovery was
made, and were thus prevented from examining the whole <i lang="la">in
sit&ucirc;</i>. This much, however, is certain, that under a diluvial
bed of drift, gravel, and sand of upwards of two feet in thickness,
underlying a thickness of at least six feet of solid moss, a flint
instrument manufactory is found, the work of a people who lived before
the deposit of that drift and the growth of that moss. How many
thousands and thousands of years ago lived that flint-working race,
who, in view of the extreme slowness of geological changes, can say? We
know that in the celebrated case of the discovery of flint weapons at
Abbeville and elsewhere in France the remains of extinct species of
elephant, rhinoceros, and other mammals were found at an immense depth
in the drift alongside of flint instruments unquestionably fashioned by
human hands. Whether our Ballachulish discovery is to be held as a
connecting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>link with a people of an antiquity as remote as
those of Abbeville, it would be rash positively to assert; but the
flint workers, some remains of whose labours have, as we have stated,
been recently brought to light in our neighbourhood, must have lived at
a period when the face of the country was geologically very different
from what it is now; and remembering how slowly as a rule geological
changes are brought about, we shall probably be still within the mark,
if approximately we fix the era of the earliest flint workers at
something like ten thousand years ago, and in the case of Abbeville,
Continental arch&aelig;ologists have had no hesitation in suggesting a
still remoter antiquity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href=

settles himself as comfortably as may be on the box-seat of the coach
in the morning. &ldquo;Not a bit of it, sir,&rdquo; responds the sturdy
agriculturist or well-to-do drover; &ldquo;not a bit of it, sir, the
finest growing weather we could have: cattle and sheep getting into
condition famously!&rdquo; [July 1873]. In such a case it is best to
avoid declaring positively for either party. <i lang="la">In medio
tutissimus ibis.</i> Both are right from their individual standpoint;
that of the agriculturist and drover being the utilitarian and
anti-poetic, while the sentimental tourist, bent on sight-seeing and
recreation, very pardonably grumbles that instead of clear skies and
refreshing breezes he is as often as not enveloped in mist and small
rain. In any case the country is at present most beautiful, and despite
the grumblings of a few, who foolishly expect to have &ldquo;a&rsquo;
the comforts of the Sautmarket&rdquo; about them whithersoever they
wander, such batches of tourists as we forgather with from time to time
are in raptures with our glens, and bens, and lochs, and richly wooded
shores, as well they may. And never before in the West Highlands were
all the conveniences for &ldquo;touristing&rdquo; with ease and
comfort, and all reasonable despatch, so perfect and so varied.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>A tolerably perfect, though not very large specimen of the
sword-fish, the <i lang="la">Xiphias gladius</i> of ichthyologists, was
cast ashore in our neighbourhood during an unusually heavy midsummer
gale from the south-west last week. The length of the elongated snout,
commonly called the sword or dagger, was two feet seven inches, a
really formidable weapon, with which it has been known, whether
willingly or unwillingly it would be difficult to say, to perforate the
bottom timbers of the stoutest ships, the sword in such cases luckily
breaking off as a rule, and thus becoming an immediate as well as an
efficient plug or stop-gap to the perforation. It is a more frequent
visitor to our shores than our natural history books would lead one to
believe, hardly a summer passing but you hear of one or more being
caught or cast ashore somewhere. This is the fourth specimen that
within twenty years has come under our personal inspection here on the
west coast. The largest and finest we ever saw was captured by a
well-known Fort-William fisherman, <i lang="gd">Iack
Cr&ugrave;bach</i>, or Lame Jack. If we well remember, we think he told
us that somebody gave him a sovereign for it. Its flesh is said to be
excellent eating, while its liver affords an oil equal to eel oil in
transparency, and of marvellous virtue, it is said, as a medicament.
The favourite habitats of the sword-fish are the Sicilian and the
Italian shores of the Mediterranean, where, at certain seasons of the
year, it is caught in great numbers, the average weight being quite a
hundred, and sometimes two hundred pounds or more. We have it in our
<i>Common-Place Book</i> that Major Healy, of the yacht
&ldquo;Wildbird,&rdquo; informed us in Fort-William (August 1869) that
he had just returned from the Mediterranean; had called on Garibaldi at
Caprera, and dined with him on potatoes and sword-fish steaks, which
the gallant Major pronounced excellent. We may state, as something
curious, that while the Major at said dinner had his choice of very
good wines, with lots of capital bottled &ldquo;Bass&rdquo; from
England, the General himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>drank a funny decoction composed
of Marsala and water&mdash;half-and-half&mdash;in which a large onion,
sliced lemon-wise, had been steeping for the whole previous
night&mdash;a drink which the Major tasted, and in very emphatic phrase
declared to be &ldquo;beastly,&rdquo; but which he shrewdly guessed had
something to do with the General&rsquo;s rheumatism and gout. Any of
our readers having a tendency thitherwards might do worse than take the
hint. There may be something in it, for we recollect, when a little boy
in Morven, that an onion was somehow considered a <i>panpharmacon</i>,
a perfect <i>panacea</i>&mdash;good for any and every ailment. That the
medi&aelig;val herbalist, like the medi&aelig;val alchemist, was often
a quack is very likely. In many instances he could hardly be otherwise
when his profession was in such repute; but it is a question if our
revulsion has not gone too far; if our modern medicinists do not rather
much overlook, too contemptuously ignore, the inherent virtues, as to
human ailments, of roots and herbs and &ldquo;flowers of the
field.&rdquo; An old lady in our neighbourhood, shrewd and intelligent
beyond most of her class, told us not long ago as she was cutting
nettles by the roadside, as an evening <i lang="fr">bonne bouche</i>
for her cow, that Stewart of Invernahyle, Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s
friend, made it a point every spring to have nettle broth or soup on
three consecutive days about the season of the vernal equinox, which he
religiously believed acted as a safe and efficient diuretic for the
remainder of the year. From <i lang="gd">Mairi Bh&agrave;n</i>,
Invernahyle&rsquo;s sister, the</p>
<div lang="gd" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;<i>Mhairi Bh&agrave;n gur barrail
thu</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">of Macintyre&rsquo;s well-known song, are descended at
least two Presbyterian clergymen, though the Invernahyles themselves
were strongly Episcopalian&mdash;ourselves, namely, and the Rev. Mr.
Cameron, Free Church minister of Ardersier. And the writing of the word
&ldquo;Episcopalian&rdquo; above reminds us of the fact that the
titular dignity of the Bishopric of Argyll and the Isles is at present
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>vacant. The late Bishop, Dr. Ewing, with whom we
had the honour of being on most intimate and friendly terms, was an
unostentatiously pious, thoroughly good, and really very able man, whom
nine-tenths of the clergy of his own Church would not or could not
understand. Thank God that in the enumeration of the good men whom we
have known, the fingers of both hands do not suffice; and of the really
good men whom we have been privileged to know and honour with
affectionate regard was the late Bishop Ewing.</p>
<p>Some months ago we wrote to an old college <i>chum</i>, now farming
in New Zealand, advising him, as some occupation for his idle hours, to
pick up and send us such scraps of songs and poems as he might find
among the Maori race around him. No uncivilised people that we had read
or heard of seemed to us, in many respects, so like our ancient
Highlanders&mdash;the Fingalians, so called, of our older ballad
poetry&mdash;and we thought that so much of their poetry and folk-lore
as could be gathered could not fail to be interesting. Our
correspondent says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Maoris, as you so shrewdly
guessed, have a good deal of poetry among them; short songs, however,
for the most part, and rhymed proverbs, and &ldquo;wisdom words,&rdquo;
as they call them, very much like the Welsh
&ldquo;<i>Triads</i>,&rdquo; for they generally teach some <i>three</i>
particular doctrines, or state historically some <i>three</i>
particular facts. A few weeks ago I got an old man who came this way to
sing me some aboriginal songs, and the one that most struck my fancy I
now send to you. It is perfectly literal, for I know the native
language well, and as you are fond of rhyming, you may put it into
verse if you like. I can only send a true translation, line for

<p class="first">&ldquo;With occasional gales, by no means out of place
or untimeous at this date [October 1873], with the sun already in its
retrogression, almost half-way back through <i>Scorpio</i>, the weather
is upon the whole mild and more autumn-like than was any portion of
autumn proper itself. Winter, as yet, has hardly descended lower than
the highest summits of our mountain ranges, and how beautiful in the
golden after-glow, even at this season, are these same mountain peaks,
impending over us like so many living presences! Tutelary divinities we
sometimes fancy them, interested in all that belongs to the dwellers at
their feet, with living hearts under their rocky ribs, loving us even
as we love them, if we only knew it, and speaking to us in their own
solemn and mysterious language, as at midnight, in our communings with
the stars, we are startled now and again by the weird, inexplicable
sighs and sounds, and deep-toned murmurings that seem to rise from glen
and corry and frowning gorge&mdash;sounds of much meaning, doubtless,
if one only knew the language, and could respond, as the sea seems to
do, in the palpitation of its heaving waves, and the boom of its
billows upon the beach. Pantheism and atheism are the very antithesis
and antipodes of each other&mdash;errors both, just as blind credulity
is the antithesis of stubborn unbelief&mdash;but, if forced to decide
in favour of either, give us pantheism for choice, as the more
poetical, at least, and pardonable error of the two; for the
recognition of a Divine intelligence pervading and dwelling lovingly in
all things is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>surely preferable to the cold and bloodless
anti-creed that professes to have searched the universe for a God, but
failed to find Him. For our own part, we have dwelt so long among the
mountains, and within sight and sound of the sea, that we have learned
to love them with a strange, undefinable affection, such as one bestows
only on what is at once weird and mysterious, as well as intelligent
and potent, and, upon the whole, beneficent and friendly. So impressed
are we with this feeling at times, that we fear that, however weighty
the advantages otherwise, a city life for us would now be irksome and
unenjoyable, and anything like a lengthened sojourn in a mountainless
land, far from the sight of ocean waves, well-nigh unendurable. There
is some meaning, however wild and improbable it may seem at first
sight, in the theory that accounts for the Egyptian pyramids as erected
by a nomade people, who finally settled along the valley of the Nile,
in remembrance of the mountains of their native land, and to serve
instead of these mountains in making the astronomical observations for
which the ancient Assyrians and Chaldeans were so famous. Be these
things as they may, we dearly love the mountains by which our humble
home is surrounded, whether basking in jubilant sunshine or wrapt in
sorrowing cloud, whether robed in midsummer green, in autumnal purple,
in brown and gold, or snow-covered and ice-bound to their base; what
time the day is shortest, and the sun, almost shorn of his beams,
shines but faint and far down at its farthest point of southern
declination. It is recorded of Queen Mary, of sanguinary, or rather
<i>igneous</i> memory, that so affected was she by the loss of Calais,
that had been in the possession of England since the victory at Cressy
under the gallant Edward III., upwards of two hundred years previously,
that she declared in her last moments that, if her body was opened
after death, the name of the lost city would be found written upon her
heart; probably the nearest approach to anything like poetry to be
found in any word or act of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>her dark and bigoted and wholly
unhappy life. If such things were possible&mdash;and the ancients, at
least, believed they were&mdash;we should be apt to say the same in our
own case of the mountain ranges and sea views around us, with which we
have held such intimate fellowship for upwards of twenty years.</p>
<p>If one asked us where he could get coals, we should without
hesitation be disposed, were it but to keep the well-known proverb in
countenance, to direct him to Newcastle-on-Tyne. If he consulted us as
to where he could best procure a serviceable and trustworthy
sword-blade of finest workmanship and highest value, we should probably
direct him to Damascus or Toledo. If slings and slingers, we should
send him to the Balearic Isles; if bows and arrows, and how to use them
with perfectest dexterity, to the Parthians; and in so advising the
anxious inquirer for coals, or the warlike weapons in question, we
should probably be disposed to feel that we had advised him wisely and
well. And suppose one wanted a &ldquo;Lochaber axe,&rdquo; where would
he most naturally look for it but in Lochaber? And yet, in all Lochaber
there is probably at this moment not a single specimen of a weapon at
one time so common and so peculiar to the district as to have been
called after it. The Secretary of the Royal Institution of a seaport
city of England wrote us lately, begging us to procure for them a
Lochaber axe, to be placed in a collection of shafted weapons in their
museum. He wrote as if he thought there need be no difficulty about the
matter; living as we do in Lochaber, he seemed to think that we could
lay our hands upon such a weapon as easily as upon a tuft of heather or
a twig of birch. We were, of course, obliged to write him in reply that
neither in Lochaber proper, nor, so far as we knew, in any of the
neighbouring districts, was there to be found a single specimen of the
formidable weapon in question. There should be a good many Lochaber
axes in the country however, though not in Lochaber. We wonder if such
a thing as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>&ldquo;Jeddart staff&rdquo; could be had to-day
in its proper locality? We recollect that during Her Majesty&rsquo;s
first visit to Scotland in 1842, when she was received by such a
splendid gathering of the Clans at Dunkeld, there was a company of a
hundred men, commanded by the Honourable Captain James Murray, brother
of Lord Glenlyon, the biggest men that could be got in Athole and the
surrounding districts, all armed with Lochaber axes, and a very fine
sight they were as they poised and swung about their ponderous and
terrible weapons. We were then but a boy at school, just entering upon
our teens, but the appearance of these kilted giants, with their
dreadful battle-axes, is as fresh and vivid as if, since that bright
and beautiful September noon, hardly thirty days had elapsed, instead
of upwards of thirty years. We doubt, however, if the Lochaber axe, so
called, as seen at Dunkeld on the occasion referred to, and as usually
shown in our collections of weapons, is at all a true representative of
the ancient arm so formidable in many a dour conflict in the hands of
the Camerons, Macmartins, Macmillans, and Macphees of Lochielside,
Glenarkaig, and Glenlochy, and of the Macdonalds of the Braes, and
Mackenzies of Lochlevenside. The weapon as now shown is decidedly too
big, too ponderous and unwieldy ever to have been used in actual fight.
Only a Clan Samson or Clan Goliath, and all of them of ancestral
stature and strength, could hope to wield such an arm in the heat and
hurry of conflict with anything like dexterity and ease. Like the
immense two-handed &ldquo;Wallace&rdquo; style of sword that is
sometimes shown to you as having been the favourite weapon of some
celebrated warrior of the middle ages and subsequent centuries, but
which it is simply impossible that any mere man could ever have wielded
with effect in actual fight, the modern Lochaber axe is too gigantic
for use, and must have been manufactured, a big pattern of a lesser
weapon, merely for parade and show. That a weapon of the kind, however,
once existed, and was a favourite arm with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>men
of Lochaber, is unquestionable, and a truly formidable weapon it must
have been. With a crescent axe face to cut with, it had a hook at the
back by which horsemen could be caught hold of and dragged from their
saddles, to be despatched at leisure as they lay helpless upon the
ground. The shaft was necessarily of considerable length, about six
feet, of ash or other tough wood, and of no greater girth than a common
hay-fork handle. The shaft of the modern weapon, however, is between
seven and eight feet long, and of a girth that an ordinary hand does
not suffice to grasp. The axe proper, too, or head of the arm usually
shown as a Lochaber axe, is nearly twice the weight of that of the
older and more business-like weapon. An Indian tomahawk with a six-foot
shaft, or a medi&aelig;val knight&rsquo;s battle-axe with a six-foot
handle, such as that with which the Bruce cleft the skull of Henry de
Boune at Bannockburn, would probably be nearer to the pattern of the
original Lochaber axe than the ridiculously big and cumbrous modern
article. You remember the scene in Scott&rsquo;s <i>Lord of the
Isles</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">A real Lochaber axe-head we have seen, never the
complete weapon properly shafted, though surely real and genuine
specimens of the old and famous war-arm must be found in some of our
museums. At what period the Lochaber axe ceased to be carried as a
battle-arm by the Highlanders it is impossible to say; probably soon
after the general introduction of fire-arms into the northern half of
the kingdom, for it was certainly not used in the &rsquo;45, nor, so
far as we know, in the &rsquo;15, nor even in the wars of Montrose; so
that for upwards of two hundred years at least it has not been used in
actual combat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=

<p class="first">When a prophet&rsquo;s vaticinations are verified by
the event, the world rarely fails to be reminded of it; when it is
otherwise, however; when the vaticinations turn out to be the very
reverse of true, people are rarely ever troubled with a note on the
matter, least of all on the part of the disappointed vaticinator
himself. The fact is that everything like vaticination had better, as a
rule, be let alone; sooner or later, and in nine cases out of ten, or
oftener, the prophet never fails to come to grief. So convinced, for
our own part, are we of this, that while reserving our right to
vaticinate and predict as much and as recklessly as anybody else, when
it so pleased us, yet, as a matter of fact, we never do venture further
into the treacherous territories of vaticination than the mere
outskirts, so to speak, of what may well be called the debateable land
of weather prognostics; and even there we tread as gingerly and
cautiously as if at this moment we were on the banks of the Prah, in
constant dread of a lurking ambuscade of fierce and fetish-valorous
Ashantees. Our weather prophecies from time to time have often, as the
courteous reader may remember, been fully justified by the event; but
if the whole truth is to be told, we fear we must confess that they
have almost as frequently turned out to be wrong, and it is not every
weather prophet who will confess so much. It requires a larger share of
magnanimity than the reader is perhaps aware of, to be able to confess
one&rsquo;s errors with anything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245"
href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>like complaisance, even in
such a matter as weather prognostics, and we therefore trust that the
following confession will be valued as it ought. Some time ago the
number of Arctic sea-fowl in our creeks and bays, and the near approach
of a rather early fall of snow to the sea line, justified us, as we
thought, in predicting an early and severe winter, meaning by
&ldquo;severe&rdquo;&mdash;for we scorn to be disingenuous in the
matter&mdash;that it was likely to be excessively <i>cold</i> as well
as unusually stormy. The experience of upwards of twenty years, during
which we have been a keen and close student of meteorological phenomena
and wild-bird life, seemed to us to warrant the conclusion at which we
had arrived. But how at mid-winter stands the fact? Why, thus: that up
to this date [January 1874], it has been, upon the whole, the
&ldquo;openest&rdquo; and mildest season for at least a quarter of a
century! How, then, about your Arctic sea-birds? the reader may
exclaim, and we can only answer that their presence so early and in
such numbers is to be accounted for by the almost incessant gales that
have been sweeping over the Atlantic and northern seas, with such
disastrous effects, for nearly two months past. Feeling the first blast
of the approaching tempest, and assured of its prolonged continuance by
a marvellous instinct, further and more correctly prescient of such
matters than man, with all his boasted science, they fled to the
shelter of our, to them in such cases, Friendly Islands; for an Arctic
web-foot dreads an unusual severity of hyperborean storms, long
continued, quite as much as it dreads an excessive intensity of
hyperborean cold, and for the same reason&mdash;both equally interfere
with the allotted comforts of its economy and due supply of food. The
winter, besides, is not yet past; whistling before one is fairly out of
the wood is proverbially foolish, and there is, after all, time enough
yet betwixt this and the vernal equinox for the advent of any amount of
cold, so that there is still a chance for our wild-bird friends and
ourselves standing higher in the reader&rsquo;s estimation as weather
prophets, ere <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>the winter is ended, than we do at present. Our
web-foot visitors from the far north, at all events, are still with us,
and in large numbers, and a very pretty sight a flock of them is as you
quietly approach them congregated in some sheltered bay, and with a
good binocular watch their graceful motions, now disporting themselves
and chasing each other in many a merry round over the surface of the
water; now, as if by common consent and in obedience to some, to you
inaudible, word of command, they seem to leap rather than dive into the
blue depths beneath them, until not one is to be seen, then as suddenly
reappearing, again to chase each other, and disport and dive, as if
they knew you were looking at them, and admired and loved them, and
would as soon cut off your finger as think of levelling a
murder-dealing weapon at creatures so beautiful and harmless.</p>
<p>A bird generally rare in our inland waters is this year quite common
on all our shores. We refer to the goosander (<i lang="la">Mergus
merganser</i>, Linn.), one of the handsomest and most interesting of
sea-fowl. Of the <i lang="la">Merganser</i> family the goosander is the
largest, and the whole order is remarkable for their serrated
mandibles, the nearest approach to anything like <i>teeth</i> to be met
with among birds, and admirably adapted for retaining firm hold, when
seized, of their slippery prey, which mainly consists of eels,
lampreys, &amp;c., in dealing with which &ldquo;kittle cattle&rdquo; in
deep water an ordinary unarmed duck-bill would be a very inefficient
weapon. Once in the firm grip of the <i lang="la">Merganser&rsquo;s</i>
serrated bill, however, the chance of such comparatively small fish as
it can alone feed upon must be very small indeed. We saw a very fine
male specimen a few days ago, which a young man had shot, believing it
to be a &ldquo;wild duck,&rdquo; as he termed it, and necessarily good
for eating. We told him that he had been guilty of a piece of very
unnecessary and indefensible cruelty, for that the bird in his hand was
in truth a <i lang="la">Merganser</i>, and no more fit to be eaten than
a ten-year-old herring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href=
"#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>gull or an octogenarian guillemot.
He looked at us with a smile, in which we thought we detected a
considerable shade of incredulity, and we do believe that the thought
passed through his mind at that moment that we only spoke so
disparagingly of the bird because we wanted to get hold of it
ourselves, either by its being given to us as a present, or for the
smallest possible money payment, and then what a jolly feed we should
have at the expense of his ornithological ignorance and juvenile
simplicity! Perhaps we do him injustice; but, at all events, he carried
the bird away with him, observing that he &ldquo;would try it at any
rate.&rdquo; We met his sister a day or two afterwards, and on
inquiring if they had cooked the &ldquo;wild duck,&rdquo; and how they
liked it, we confess that it was with an inward chuckle of intense
satisfaction that we listened as she told us that, after having duly
boiled and cooked it <i lang="la">secundum artem</i>, until it
<i>ought</i> to have been good and tender, it turned out to be so rank,
and fishy, and tough, that no one could eat a morsel of it, and it had
to be thrown into the dinner refuse basket as worthless! These birds,
though necessarily hardy, and able to outlive a vast amount of cold and
storm, are exceedingly fond of still water, rarely resting or fishing
when there is any surface disturbance beyond a slight ripple; and hence
it is that you so seldom meet with them elsewhere than in the most
sheltered bays, creeks, and estuaries, where the water is least liable
to the surface turmoil and commotion of a storm. The finest stuffed
specimen of the <i lang="la">Merganser</i> we ever saw is at Achnacarry
Castle, Lochiel&rsquo;s seat in Lochaber.</p>
<p>We have said above that the winter has thus far been almost
unprecedentedly open and mild, by which we mean only that the
temperature throughout has been unusually high, not, by any means, that
it has been <i>calm</i>. The very contrary is the case. It has been one
continued storm, with an occasional breathing time, so to speak, of a
fine day at rare intervals, for upwards of eight <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>consecutive weeks. But the storms have, <i>as to
temperature</i>, been rather the storms of early summer or autumn, than
the boisterously cold and burly shriekings of the lone winter
&ldquo;Storm King,&rdquo; as we used to know and fear him. The reader
will best understand what we mean, when we say that, notwithstanding
the storminess, <i>anemometrically</i>, of the season, not a single
snowflake has fallen in the lowlands of Nether Lochaber this winter,
except a little which fell last night, but of which there are no traces
again this morning; nor, except twice, and then only for an hour or so,
has the thermometer touched the freezing-point. We much doubt if the
thickness of a sixpenny piece of ice could be gathered at any one
moment from pool or puddle in our district of Lochaber during the
present winter. The consequence is, that in all our gardens flowers are
at this moment in bloom that perhaps were never known to be in bloom at
the same date before. Our privet and elder hedges bear quite a close
green vesture of young leaves; the columbine has already reached an
April altitude of growth, and a woman who happened to walk from
Fort-William early last week brought us a small bouquet of primroses
that she had picked up while passing through the woods of
Coirrechaorachan, as beautiful and perfect as if it were in truth the
proper season of these favourite flowers, instead of the last days of
the first month of the year. We shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, however, if we
have to pay for it all yet, ere the truant schoolboy again begins to
imitate the cuckoo&rsquo;s note, or &ldquo;the voice of the turtle is
heard in our land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is at this moment sitting in our kitchen a poor, half-witted
natural, &ldquo;<span class="sc">Lachlan Gorach</span>,&rdquo; from
Mull, whose conversation is always garnished with &ldquo;Davie
Gelletly&rdquo;-like snatches of quaint song. Sometimes the rhyme is in
English, and sometimes in Gaelic, and frequently has no connection
whatever with what may be the immediate subject of conversation. On
going up to have a crack with him a few moments ago&mdash;for poor
Lachlan is, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>in a way, a great favourite of ours&mdash;he
returned our friendly greeting of &ldquo;Well, how are you,
Lachlan?&rdquo; with a hearty shake of the hand, and a bow that, for
close proximity of forehead to the ground and duration, might have
graced the court of Louis the Fourteenth, and immediately on regaining
the erect position, struck, to an air that was probably original, into
the following verse, which we took down on the spot:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e978">&ldquo;First the heel and then the toe,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">That&rsquo;s the way the polka goes;</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">First the toe and then the heel,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">That&rsquo;s the way to dance a reel;</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Quick about and then away,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Lightly dance the glad Strathspey.</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Jump a jump, and jump it big,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">That&rsquo;s the way to dance a jig;</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Slowly, smiling as in France,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Follow through the country dance.</p>
<p class="line">And we&rsquo;ll meet Johnny Cope in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It was very amusing. Where he picked up the uncouth
rhyme we do not know, and it was bootless to inquire. Having ordered
him some dinner, we bade him good-bye, when we caught hold of the
following verse of Lachlan&rsquo;s favourite ditties as we
disappeared:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Kilt your coaties, bonnie lassie,</p>
<p class="line">As you wade the burnie through;</p>
<p class="line">Or your mother will be angry</p>
<p class="line">If you wet your coaties now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Poor Lachlan, always cheerful and perfectly harmless,
is a welcome guest at every fireside throughout the many districts
which he periodically peregrinates. We may have something more to say
of himself and his quaint scraps of songs on a future occasion.

&ldquo;Villeneuve.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is true to a proverb that one may have too much
even of a good thing. It was the most natural thing in the world, for
instance, that our countrymen should have introduced the thistle, the
national emblem, into the fertile plains and straths of Australia and
New Zealand, to remind them of home, and to speak to them, even at the
Antipodes, of memories and traditions that patriotism will in nowise
&ldquo;willingly let die.&rdquo; The inevitable result of such
introduction, however, was not foreseen, or rather was never thought
of. A correspondent in the province of Otago, in a very pleasant letter
by last mail [August 1874] informs us that the &ldquo;symbol
dear&rdquo; of Burns has so flourished and spread over large tracts of
land in New Zealand as to be already an intolerable nuisance; so much
so, that legislative enactments are being passed, in view, if possible,
to its total extirpation. &ldquo;You may think I exaggerate,&rdquo;
says our friend, &ldquo;but I positively do not, when I tell you that
in the course of a fifty miles ride the other day I saw whole paddocks
containing many hundred acres of splendid land quite overrun with
thistles, so close, and thick, and formidable, that neither man nor
horse could force a way through them. And such thistles, too! I
measured several that were quite eight feet in height, and as thick in
the stem as my wrist, with spikes on them as large as horse-shoe nails,
and as sharp-pointed as the sharpest needle. The proprietor of one of
the paddocks thus overgrown <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>with thistles swore at them
awfully&mdash;and most unpatriotically, too, you will say, for he was a
Scotchman&mdash;when I spoke to him on the subject. I assure you it is
a very serious matter, for unless the obnoxious weed is somehow got rid
of, many places will soon be uninhabitable, and, as you can easily
understand, the evil is daily and rapidly becoming worse. The thistles
are at present ripe, with large heads like cauliflowers, and when a
smart breeze is blowing, where they are plentiful, the air is filled
with thistle-down like a heavy snow-storm. If you, who know so many
things, could only suggest some effectual way of ridding ourselves of
this pest, you would be doing us a very real service.&rdquo; At home,
too, thistles, if not more plentiful, are at least of larger growth
than usual. In a corner of our own garden, for instance, there is still
growing at the present moment a splendid fellow, nearly six feet in
height, to which we pay a daily visit in admiration of its lusty
growth, and the rich emerald green of its imbricated involucral leaves.
We have purposely preserved it unhurt till now, as something of a
curiosity, but in a day or two it must be cut down, for the seeds are
fast ripening, and it were unwise, if not actually criminal, to allow
them to escape on downy wings only to fall and germinate after their
kind, a very nuisance, elsewhere. Most herbaceous plants will bleed to
death if cut down two years running, just as they have about attained
half their growth; and we can only suggest to our New Zealand friends
that they should treat their thistle fields after a similar fashion.
Let them be mowed down when about half, or rather more than half-grown,
with the scythe for two consecutive seasons, and we believe the roots
will infallibly die and disappear. We have known bracken, ragwort, and
burr-dock, &amp;c. very effectively disposed of in this way, and have
some confidence that thistles, too, might be thoroughly eradicated by a
similar process of vital wounding at the hastiest stage of growth. From
our correspondent&rsquo;s description of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>them, we should say
that the New Zealand thistles, so loudly complained of, are of the same
species as that in our garden, the <i lang="la">Carduus marianus</i> of
botanists, or Great Milk Thistle, a biennial common over all Europe,
but nowhere so plentiful as in Scotland, whence it is probable that it
is so frequently pointed to by poets, painters, and patriots as the
Scotch Thistle, though its claims to the high honour of being the
actual and real national emblem are somewhat questionable. The
tradition in the south and south-west, where the true story, if ever
there was a true story in the matter, is most likely to have rooted
itself in its perfectest form, is to the effect that, during an
invasion of the Norsemen, the Danes advancing against the Scots on a
dark night, one of their barefooted scouts, when prowling about the
Scottish encampment, chanced to tread on a thistle, the sharp prickles
of which piercing his foot, caused him to utter a loud imprecation,
which reaching the ears of the Scots, hitherto lying in fancied
security, warned them that the enemy was at hand, and enabled them,
instantly standing to their arms, to take their foes at such
disadvantage that the fierce Norsemen were totally routed and driven to
their ships with immense slaughter. The thistle that thus opportunely
prevented the Scots being taken unawares is still pointed out, not,
however, as being any of the large, formidable, long-stemmed varieties,
but the <i>stemless</i> thistle that spreads out its leaves and spikes
quite close to the ground, common enough in old pastures and waste
grass lands. The stemless thistle is botanically known as the <i lang=
"la">Cnicus acaulis</i>, and lowly and unpretending as it may seem at
first sight, there is, we make bold to assert, no species of thistle so
well entitled to bear and boast the grand old legend, <i lang="la">Nemo
me impune lacessit</i>. Its spines are as fine, and quite as tough and
piercing withal, as the finest cambric needle; impossible, too, of
extraction, once it has fairly penetrated the flesh, except by a
surgical operation; and we have a shrewd suspicion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>that
it is to some extent poisonous, for, from the moment one pierces the
flesh till its expulsion by suppuration of the part, the pain is keen
and excruciating beyond conception. Barefooted Dane, Saxon, or Celt,
unexpectedly treading on a nearly ripe and full-formed <i lang=
"la">Cnicus</i>, might well be excused an oath, however lusty and loud,
in acknowledgment and hearty execration of such an impediment. We can
say something of a <i lang="la">Cnicus</i> spike wound from personal
experience. Several years ago, when we were younger and lighter than we
are to-day, we were vaulting over a wall that divided an infield of
corn from an outfield of old pasture. Safely over, but alighting
awkwardly, we slipped forward and fell, instinctively stretching out
our hands to secure ourselves as we came almost headlong to the ground.
The fall was nothing, but one of our hands had, as ill-luck would have
it, alighted, with all our weight upon it, in the very bosom of a
full-armed, irate <i lang="la">Cnicus</i>. The palm of the hand somehow
escaped, but one of the prickles entered our wrist, and the pain was at
once intense&mdash;stinging, sharp, and burning, as if the spike was
the point of a red-hot needle from the fire. It could not be extracted,
for it could not be seen; and there was nothing for it but patience and
such local applications as might best aid the inevitable suppuration by
which alone, after fourteen days&rsquo; acute pain, relief was finally
obtained. Upon the whole, then, and keeping the barefooted Danish scout
tradition in view, we are disposed to consider the stemless <i lang=
"la">Cnicus</i> as the true national emblem. If there be any doubt, the
honour, at all events, must be left between itself and the burly,
big-stemmed <i lang="la">Marianus</i>. Of a certainty, in any case, the
cotton thistle (<i lang="la">Onopordon acanthium</i>), though
frequently spoken of by horticulturists and amateur gardeners as the
Scotch thistle, cannot be the species indicated, for this last is not
properly a Scotch plant at all, it being rarely, if ever, found growing
wild anywhere north of the Tweed, though comparatively <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>common in England. The first public and properly
authenticated mention of the thistle as the national badge is, we
believe, in an inventory of the jewels and wardrobe effects of James
III., about the year 1467. Whether there was an &ldquo;ancient&rdquo;
Order of the Thistle seems doubtful; what is commonly called the
revival of the order dates from the reign of James the Seventh of
Scotland, Second of England, in 1687.</p>
<p>A more natural and less apocryphal combat than the recent dwarf and
bulldog business at Hanley is the following. Be not alarmed; ours is
simply a brief account of a fight, fierce <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6700" title="Source: and and">and</span> furious enough to be
sure, but very natural&mdash;for of the <i lang="la">Phocid&aelig;</i>,
we suppose, as of the &ldquo;bears and lions&rdquo; in the well-known
hymn, it may be predicted that &ldquo;&rsquo;tis their nature
to&rdquo;&mdash;a fight, then, between a pair of dog-seals in the bay
under our house a few evenings ago. In nothing else are the results of
the Gun Tax Act so pleasantly manifest as in the increased, and still
increasing, confidence and friendly relations now so happily
established between seals and sea-birds of every kind and the sea-side
naturalist, as, throwing books and papers for the time aside, he takes
his evening walk abroad within sight and sound of the setting sunlit
sea, that gently <span class="corr" id="xd26e6706" title=
"Source: murmers">murmurs</span> the while, as if for very gladness, in
response to the rosy smile of the departing god. Ever since the
beginning of summer, a large dog-seal, recognisable as such by his
immense, square, bulldog-like head and fierce hirsute beard, has made
our beautiful Onich Bay his favourite evening fishing-ground, until we
have come to know him perfectly; no difficult matter either, for he has
a curious grey patch, larger than one&rsquo;s hand, on his left cheek,
and, unlike most seals, sinks, not log-like, when he disappears under
water, but almost always with a lively &ldquo;header,&rdquo; in which
the whole back, arched and shining, is brought to view, as if for our
special delectation, as we sit and watch his graceful motions with a
glass powerful enough to detect the wary and intelligent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>glance of his beautiful dark-brown eye, and
count, if need were, every separate bristle in his moustache. He is a
big and powerful animal, and when in our bay doubtless accounts himself
lord of all he surveys, for, of the hundreds of seals in Loch Leven, he
alone constantly frequents this particular semi-oval, sandy-bottomed
inlet, his size and strength probably ensuring it to him as a sort of
reserve, in which woe unto the interloping poacher caught sight of
<i lang="la">flagrante delicto</i> by the bright eye of &ldquo;Lord
Nelson,&rdquo; as we have long since called him, and all the people
about call him, for he is now known to everybody in the hamlet, and
frequently spoken about with all the interest attached to a wild
animal, actually suspicious and shy, but perfectly harmless, when, with
a confidence extremely rare in animals of its kind, it approaches human
habitations. On the afternoon of Friday last, &ldquo;Nelson&rdquo; was
fishing, as usual, in our bay, which at the time was mirror-smooth and
calm as calm could be. We had watched him for some time through our
glass, and seen him come to the surface more than once, and dispose of
a flounder in his usual quiet and leisurely way, when, somewhat to our
surprise, we caught sight of another seal, seemingly as large as
&ldquo;Nelson&rdquo; himself, and about a hundred yards from him; and
at the same moment his &ldquo;lordship&rdquo; evidently saw him too!
There could be no mistake about it, for he, first raising himself
half-way out of the water, and gazing excitedly around, with a splendid
header and a very significant flourish of his hind flippers, instantly
dived; the stranger seal also, who probably knew what was coming,
diving immediately afterwards. What happened below is only known to
such subaqueous spectators as might be about at the moment; we can only
bear witness to what followed, and that was, that in about two minutes
there was wild splashing and violent commotion of the waters near the
spot at which the stranger seal had disappeared, from the centre of
which turmoil the two seals soon emerged, fighting in fierce grip like
a pair of enraged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256"
name="pb256">256</a>]</span>bulldogs. For several minutes this wild
combat continued; Greek had met Greek; the belligerents hugging each
other, bear-like, with their anterior flippers, and tearing at each
other&rsquo;s heads and throats with their terrible fangs, for the
canine teeth of seals are exceedingly formidable, and their strength of
jaw enormous. All this time they wrestled and rolled over and over each
other in deadly and desperate encounter, the sea for yards around them
one sheet of boiling, hissing foam, here and there streaked with blood,
as we could plainly discern by the aid of the glass, for we had, in the
meantime, advanced to the very margin of the sea, and were standing
within some thirty yards of them. In the wild hurly-burly of the
conflict, it was impossible to see or say whether &ldquo;Nelson&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Villeneuve&rdquo; was winning&mdash;for by the latter name
had our son, who was along with us, already dubbed the stranger seal,
as, with true boy-like interest and eagerness, he watched the fight.
Had there been any betting on the event, we, knowing
&ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo; and believing in his prowess&mdash;for it was
impossible to be impartial in such a case&mdash;would probably have
laid two to one freely on our favourite; remembering, too, the pithy
Gaelic adage, &ldquo;<i lang="gd">&rsquo;S laidir c&ugrave; air a
dh&ugrave;nan fein</i>:&rdquo; Strong is the dog that has his own home
knoll for a battle-field! As it was, the battle was fought out and
finished under water, so that we were not privileged to see the last of
it. After a final fierce worry, in which the combatants reared their
bodies more than half-way out of the water, and much surface splashing
and somersaulting, the belligerents, as if by common consent,
disappeared, still fighting, however, as the hundreds of bursting
bubbles that for a time kept coming to the surface clearly testified.
In about a couple of minutes the stranger seal came to the surface,
swimming rapidly seawards; <i>he</i> had evidently had enough of it;
and shortly afterwards, &ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo; known at once by the grey
patch on his cheek, reappeared in the centre of the bay, quietly
floating about, as if thoroughly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"
href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>tired of the tussle, and
shaking his head dog-fashion now and again, from which we gathered that
&ldquo;Villeneuve,&rdquo; though beaten, had left his mark upon the
victor, and the victor was in this wise very significantly
acknowledging the fact. It is worthy of remark, that throughout the
whole of this curious fight, though from first to last it was as fierce
and furious as anything of the kind could be, not a sound was uttered
by either combatant, except an occasional heavy, sigh-like breathing,
which was probably involuntary, and merely the natural result of
unwonted physical exertion. And yet seals are by no means dumb, for
their curious bleatings&mdash;we can find no better word for
it&mdash;in the breeding season, must be known to every sea-side
naturalist. &ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo; the reader will perhaps be glad to
hear, is all right again, and, as yet, sole admiral of our bay, in
which at this moment, as we write, he is busy fishing for supper.

<p class="first">Wounds from Stags&rsquo; Antlers exceedingly
dangerous&mdash;The old Fingalian Ballads&mdash;Number of Dogs kept for
the Chase&mdash;Dr. Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ancient Lays&rdquo; of modern
manufacture&mdash;The Spotted Crake (<i lang="la">Crex Prozana</i>) at
Inverness&mdash;Its Habits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is not generally known, we believe, that a wound
from a stag&rsquo;s antlers, however slight&mdash;the merest scratch or
abrasion of the skin, if only blood is drawn&mdash;is exceedingly
dangerous. A short time ago [December 1874], on ascending from the
cabin of a steamer, we went forward in order to enjoy an uninterrupted
smoke in the fresh breeze that swept across the vessel, when we noticed
a fine-looking young man, closely wrapped up in cape and plaid seated,
in the shelter of the capstan, as if the breeze, to him at least, was,
if anything, too brisk and keen. Glancing at him once and again, we
observed that he was pale and sickly looking; and concluding from his
dress and caste of features that he must be a Highlander, we went over
to him and addressed him in Gaelic. It turned out that although we did
not know him, he knew something of us, and we were soon on friendly
terms. He told us he was going to Glasgow to consult the doctors about
a stag&rsquo;s horn wound in the thigh that was daily, in spite of all
the salves, ointments, and healing applications that he and all the
&ldquo;wise&rdquo; people of his glen could think of, getting worse
instead of better. About two months ago he was helping to take a stag
off a hill pony&rsquo;s back, when, by some accident, the sharp point
of one of the tines penetrated the thigh for a short distance, and
then, by the force of the falling weight of the head, rasped downwards
for about an inch and a half, leaving an ugly, ragged gash, though of
no great depth. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259"
name="pb259">259</a>]</span>thought but little of it, he told us,
having often had more serious wounds before, though not from a
stag&rsquo;s horn, that gave hardly any trouble, and soon healed of
themselves&mdash;of the first intention, as the surgeons have it. How
it may fare with him among the Glasgow doctors we do not know: well,
poor fellow, we sincerely hope, though we shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the
wound continued to trouble him all his life long. The subject of
stag-horn wounds having thus been brought before us in a way that could
not fail to interest us, we took the matter to avizandum, as the
sheriffs say; and, in dearth of anything better at this dull season, we
present our readers with the result of our inquiries in every direction
whence there was the least chance of enlightenment. Dogs wounded by
stags&rsquo; horns usually die from mortification or gangrene of the
wound; and even if the wound heals, and they recover, it is only in an
unsatisfactory sort of way, for they are almost always afterwards
paralytic in the wounded limb, or they are epileptic. An old forester,
who knows more about deer and deerhounds than anybody else we ever met,
tells us that in very few instances has he ever known a dog that has
actually bled at the touch of a stag&rsquo;s horn, recover in such wise
as to be fairly serviceable again. With the least drop of blood in such
cases, they seem to lose all their courage. Another man, a shepherd
near us, says that a very fine collie dog of his was once severely
wounded by a stag in Glenarkaig, on Lochiel&rsquo;s estate, and that
although the wound healed satisfactorily enough, and to the eye of an
ordinary observer there was nothing the matter with the dog, it was, in
fact, ever afterwards perfectly useless. &ldquo;Chaidh e g&ograve;rach,
le&rsquo;r cead.&rdquo; A good dog before, &ldquo;he became perfectly
stupid, sir!&rdquo; said the man. The above-mentioned forester says
that the poisonous character of stag-horn wounds is well known to every
one in the least acquainted with deer-stalking, as the sport was
followed in the good old ante-breech-loading rifle days, when explosive
bullets were yet unknown; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=
"#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>and that rough contact with the
tines of the animal, whether living or dead, was, in his younger days,
avoided as one would avoid the tooth of a rabid dog or a viper&rsquo;s
fang. A stag antler&rsquo;s wound, he avers, is dangerous at all times,
but most so in the end of autumn&mdash;the rutting season&mdash;or, as
he put it, &ldquo;an &agrave;m dhaibh &rsquo;bhi dol &rsquo;san
damhair,&rdquo; when they take to their &ldquo;wallowing pools.&rdquo;
Curiously enough, and by the merest accident, we have fallen in with
the following proverbial distich from an old volume on <i>Venerie, or
Hunting of the Buck</i>, published in London in 1622:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;If thou art hurt by boar&rsquo;s tooth, the
leech thy life may save;</p>
<p class="line">If thou art hurt by buck&rsquo;s horn, &rsquo;twill
bring thee to thy grave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So that the venom of a stag&rsquo;s horn wound seems
to have been quite as well known two hundred years ago as it is now;
better, indeed, for those who followed the chase in the olden time were
more liable to such hurts than is possible in the case of the modern
deer-stalker, when the aid of dogs and the &ldquo;gillie&rsquo;s&rdquo;
knife to give the <i lang="fr">coup de grace</i> to the &ldquo;stag at
bay,&rdquo; are matters of comparatively little moment. It was a much
more serious and risky affair in the days of the old
&ldquo;flint&rdquo;-bearing musket. There was a paragraph a short time
ago about a serious attack by a stag on some men in the island of
Raasay. It would be interesting to know whether blood was drawn on the
occasion, and if so, how the wounds have healed.</p>
<p>Hardly anything in our old <i>Ossianic</i> ballads, of which we have
such an interesting and ably edited collection in Mr. J. F. Campbell of
Islay&rsquo;s <i lang="gd">Leabhar-na-Feinne</i>, is so curious as the
great number of dogs employed by the Fingalians in their
huntings,&mdash;that is, if we are to read the ballads with anything
like literalness. Fifty, a hundred, two hundred, and even five hundred
dogs are spoken about as freely as a modern sportsman speaks of
couples. In one ballad, for instance, recovered by ourselves, ten men,
one of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>the balladist himself, the last remnant of the
Fingalian host, are represented as going to hunt in the &ldquo;Glen of
Mist,&rdquo; attended by fifty dogs a piece, or five hundred in
all&mdash;surely an unnecessary, if not an impossible number. In these
ballads, besides, you find frequent reference to scarcity of food, and
the shifts the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; were often put to, to provide for
the barest wants of the passing day; and yet, if such an army of dogs
was necessary, it also had to be fed, which one conceives must have
been a matter of some difficulty, when the heroes themselves were, as
the ballads inform us, frequently reduced to the necessity of splitting
&ldquo;marrow bones,&rdquo; when all the flesh that covered them had
already been used up. The whole question of the natural history of
these old ballads is well worth more attention than has yet been
bestowed on it. Some day or other we shall devote a special chapter to
it. Meantime, let us merely say that we decided many years ago against
the authenticity and genuineness of one at least of Dr. Smith&rsquo;s
so-called <i>Ancient Lays</i>, because of the incorrectness of a
reference to the natural history of a well-known bird, the common
pigeon. Here are the lines in <i>Gaul</i> which first made us shake our
head in dubiety over the genuineness of the composition&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="gd" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mar cholum an carraig na h-Ulacha,</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;S i solar dhearca da h-&agrave;l beag,</p>

<p class="line">Tra dh&rsquo;eireas an t-seabhag &rsquo;na

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">As a dove on the rock of Ulla,</p>
<p class="line">That gathereth berries for her young;</p>
<p class="line">Oft she returns, nor tastes herself the food,</p>
<p class="line">When rises the hawk within her thoughts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">On which passage we would first of all remark that
pigeons are not berry eaters, and even if they were, they would not
carry them to their young in such wise as the poet clearly implies. A
pigeon itself eats the food meant for its young, and only after
undergoing a certain process of maceration and digestion in the
parent&rsquo;s crop, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262"
name="pb262">262</a>]</span>is it again regurgitated in form suitable
for the young. In genuine Gaelic poetry, the natural history is in a
very remarkable manner almost invariably correct. Here it was not, and
we recollect tossing the volume aside, and remarking that while much of
<i>Gaul</i> might certainly be &ldquo;ancient,&rdquo; quite as much was
modern, and that, wittingly or unwittingly, Dr. Smith had been dealing
in patch-work. Dr. Smith cites a parallel passage to the above from
Thomson&rsquo;s <i>Spring</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e6800">&ldquo;Away they fly,</p>
<p class="line">Affectionate, and, undesiring, bear</p>
<p class="line">The most delicious morsel to their young.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the context shows that Thomson is not referring to
doves, but to <i>Turdi</i> and warblers that build</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e3679">&ldquo;Among the roots</p>
<p class="line">Of hazel pendent o&rsquo;er the plaintive
stream.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And these do feed their callow young as represented in
the poem, though the <i lang="la">Columbid&aelig;</i> certainly do
not.</p>
<p>We observe that Mr. T. B. Snowie, of Inverness, has recently been so
fortunate as to secure a specimen of the <i>spotted crake</i> or
<i lang="la">Crex porzana</i>, a very rare bird indeed, of which we
never saw a living specimen. It seems, however, to be a more regular
visitor to our shores than is imagined, specimens having from time to
time been met with in almost all parts of Scotland. Our friend Mr.
Robert Gray, in his excellent volume on <i>The Birds of the West of
Scotland and the Outer Hebrides</i>, writes of the spotted crake as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;So far as I have observed, the spotted crake is a
very uncommon species in the western counties; it is, however, more
numerously distributed throughout the eastern counties, extending from
Orkney to Berwickshire. In Aberdeen and Forfar shires, according to
Macgillivray, it can scarcely be called very rare. &lsquo;In
Scotland,&rsquo; says Mr. More in the <i>Ibis</i>, &lsquo;the nest has
been found only in Perth, Aberdeen, and at Loch Spynie, in Elgin; but
as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>birds have been repeatedly taken in the breeding
season in Banffshire, Fife, East Lothian, and Berwick, it is not
unreasonable to infer that the species nest in these counties also. In
the west of Scotland, the spotted crake has been taken in Wigtonshire,
Renfrewshire, and Argyllshire; but I have no authentic instance of its
occurrence north of the last-named district. In its habits this bird
closely resembles its congener the water-rail, and, like it, is not
easily flushed from its haunts. Although a migratory species, the
spotted crake appears to come early, specimens being occasionally taken
about the beginning of April; as a rule, it also lingers much later
than other migratory birds, stray examples having been shot in
November, December, and even January, so that it is absent not more
than two or three months. It may, indeed, be yet found to be, in some
of the southern districts, permanently resident. From its shy and
unobtrusive habits, and its life of seclusion and silence in marshy
places, from which it but rarely issues, it is much less frequently
seen than birds which try to escape by flight when disturbed. Rather
than take wing, it will thrust itself, when molested, into any hole or
tuft of grass, and remain concealed until quiet is restored; and on
this account the comparative numbers of the species cannot readily be
ascertained.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bird is, however, unquestionably a <i lang="la">rara avis</i>, a
<i lang="la">rarissima avis</i> even, in the north of Scotland, and to
have seen the bird as Mr. Snowie was privileged to see and handle it,
we should cheerfully have walked ten miles, were it the coldest day in
mid-winter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=

again, when the tide is at ebb, to search for objects of interest in
marine animal and vegetable life, in every likely spot along what
<i>Ossian</i> calls &ldquo;tr&agrave;igh na faoch,&rdquo;&mdash;the
periwinkled shore. Our friend and neighbour Dr. Clerk, by the way, in
his admirable edition of the great Celtic bard, renders it &ldquo;the
shore of <i>whelks</i>,&rdquo; and in a note gives us to understand
that he thinks the expression so unpoetical, <i>infra dig.</i>, and
every way inappropriate, as almost to warrant its rejection as a
corruption of the text. As a conjectural emendation, he suggests
&ldquo;<span lang="gd">tr&agrave;igh na <i>faobh</i></span>,&rdquo; the
shore of <i>spoils</i>, as probably the true reading. <i>Faoch</i>,
however, is not the whelk, but the periwinkle or <i>wilk</i>. The whelk
is the <i lang="la">Buccinum undatum</i>, the <i>cnogag</i> or
<i>cnocag</i> of the Gaels of the Western seaboard and Hebrides. The
wilk or periwinkle is the <i>faoch</i> or <i>faochag</i>; and to it and
not to the whelk the passage clearly refers. The whelk or <i>cnogag</i>
rarely allows itself to be left behind on the beach by the receding
waters, even in spring tides, when ebbs are at their lowest. The
periwinkle, on the contrary, sticks, regardless of the receding waves,
to its place or stone or algae stem and frond, until the ebbing waters
have returned, as return he knows full well they shall; so that at any
time after half ebb, a suitable shore, rich in alg&aelig;, presents a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>most interesting sight, every stone and smallest
bit of sea-weed covered with millions of periwinkles at all stages of
growth. It is to a scene of this kind that the poet refers, and very
happily we think: &ldquo;the periwinkled shore&rdquo; is a thousand
times better than the &ldquo;barren, barren shore&rdquo; of Tennyson.
No one objects to &ldquo;daisied mead&rdquo; or &ldquo;daisied
lea,&rdquo; and &ldquo;periwinkled shore,&rdquo; as we have seen it,
and as hundreds, we make no doubt, of our readers have also seen it,
is, to our thinking, every whit as poetical, and in no sense
inconsistent even with epic dignity. Wilks having within recent years
become an article of considerable marketable value, being carefully
gathered on every beach, the &ldquo;periwinkled shore&rdquo; of Ossian
is, of course, a rarer sight now-a-days than it used to be. Nearly as
plentiful on our shores as the common periwinkle itself is its first
cousin, the <i lang="la">Purpura lapillus</i> of conchologists, or
yellow periwinkle, one of those creatures that furnished the famous
purple dye of the ancients. It has a bitter, astringent taste, and is
in consequence not eaten like its congener, the wilk. We have said that
our favourite morning walk is invariably, if we can accomplish it,
along the sea-beach; and hardly a day passes but we can show something
interesting and new, picked up in these our littoral perambulations.
After a storm particularly, we endeavour, whatever our other
engagements, to devote an hour at least to a ramble along the shore,
and it is rarely we return empty-handed: some curious waif or other,
cast up by the storm, seldom fails to be forthcoming as the reward of
our matutinal diligence. After a severe gale one morning last week, we
found a dead <i>kittiwake</i>, but perfectly plump and fresh, lying on
the top of a mass of drift tangle. The bird itself was no great rarity,
for the kittiwake (<i lang="la">Larus rissa</i>, Linn.), a very pretty
little gull, is common on all our shores, even in winter. The curious
thing was that, on taking up the bird in our hand, we found that one of
its feet was firmly held in the vice-like grasp of a large mussel, the
mussel in its turn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266"
name="pb266">266</a>]</span>being anchored by its <i>byssus</i> to a
tangle root (<i lang="la">Laminaria digitata</i>) of immense size. The
poor kittiwake had evidently been fairly trapped: the case was clear.
Walking along the beach at low-water, in search of food, it must have
stepped inadvertently and unwittingly into the jaws, so to speak, of
the open, or rather half-open, mussel, which, in resentment of the
intrusion, instantly closing with a steel trap-like snap, held the poor
bird firm and fast. There was no chance or hope of escape, and the
unfortunate little gull, thus anchored to the bottom, was miserably
drowned by the advancing tide. Its body would, to a certain extent, act
as a float or buoy to the mussel and tangle root, which, thus loosened,
the storm would readily dislodge, and cast up on the beach, even as we
found it. Web-feet of all kinds are, of course, as liable to death in
all its forms, natural and accidental, as any other animals, but we
dare to say that in any accurate return of the vital statistics of
sea-birds, death by <i>drowning</i>, Ophelia-like, would be found about
the rarest. In more ways than one, therefore, was our dead kittiwake a
curiosity of no every-day occurrence, though, in nineteen cases out of
twenty, the passer-by would probably be content to kick it aside as a
dead gull, and no more, if, indeed, he condescended to notice it at
all. We were lately told an amusing story about a Fort-William man who
lived some fifty years ago, and was in his day a great shore-searcher
after storms, incited thereto, not exactly in the interests of science,
but by more mundane and prosaic considerations. Summer and winter, all
the year round, he searched the shores (<i lang="gd">Bhi&rsquo;dh e
g&rsquo;iarraidh nan cladaichan</i>, was the phrase) of Achintore and
Drumarbin after every gale of wind, wandering ghost-like in the grey
dawn by the margin of the sea, and diligently picking up every
conceivable article of <i>flotsam</i> and <i>jetsam</i> that came in
his way. In all this there was perhaps nothing to object to; but this
mild specimen of a Cornish wrecker had the habit of appropriating,
without compunction, such oars, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267"
href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>thwarts, baling-dishes, and
other articles of boat gearing as came in his way, even though he knew
that they belonged to his neighbours, and had only been carried away
from their proper places by an unusually high tide or a gale of wind.
This was a breach of the etiquette and good-neighbourhood prevailing
among boatmen that could not be tolerated. A Drumarbin man, therefore,
who had lost some oars in a storm, and suspected that the Fort-William
shore-searcher had found and kept them, determined on reprisal, and in
hope of curing him of such shabby peculations, to give him a good
fright, which could be done the more easily, as the shore-searcher was
a nervous, timid creature, brimful of belief in apparitions, ghosts,
and ghost stories of the wildest and most improbable character. Getting
up one morning after a storm, the Drumarbin man put on a pair of new
shoes, and slipping to the shore, unobserved by the wrecker, whom he
could see wandering along the beach, as was his custom, in the grey
day-break, he lay down at length on the shingle, and covered his head
and body down to his ankles with the drift-ware that had been cast up
by the storm. All he left exposed was his feet, on which we have said
there was a pair of good substantial new shoes. Meanwhile the
&ldquo;wrecker&rdquo; was advancing along the beach, carefully
searching about, and stooping from time to time, oyster-catcher or
curlew-wise, in order to pick up such waifs and strays as he fancied
worth the while. At last he reached the recumbent and sea-ware-covered
Drumarbin man. The shoes at once caught his eye, and as he gazed
wistfully on what he considered the most fortunate and valuable
<i>jetsam</i> that had fallen to his luck for a long time, he was heard
to soliloquise,&mdash;&ldquo;A drowned man! Poor fellow; but he has
good shoes on, and as he can have no more use for them, I may as well
take them now as anybody else later in the day.&rdquo; No sooner said
than done. Throwing down his bundle of gatherings, he pulled the shoes
evenly and steadily off the supposed &ldquo;body&rsquo;s&rdquo; feet,
and was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>moving away with them, when a smothered
sepulchral voice from under the sea-ware struck his ear&mdash;an ear
painfully acute under the circumstances,&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang=
"gd">Gabh mo chomhairl&rsquo; &rsquo;s f&agrave;g na br&ograve;gan
sin!</span>&rdquo; &ldquo;Take my advice, and leave these shoes
alone!&rdquo; At the same time he saw the mass of drift-weed heaving
and moving. Dropping the shoes as if they had suddenly become each a
mass of red-hot iron in his hand, he started off with a yell that
frightened the sea-birds all the way to <i>Camus-na-Gall</i>, and ran a
terrible race without once halting or looking over his shoulder, till,
penitent and breathless, he reached his own fireside. He was completely
cured of shore-wandering, for, as our informant told us, he soon after
sickened and took to his bed, from which he never rose again. Told in
excellent Gaelic, and with a large admixture of the serio-comic quiet
humour so characteristic of an old Highlander, the story made us laugh
heartily; and not the less so that it was told in sly reference to our
own frequent sea-shore perambulations.</p>
<p>It is many years since our wild birds have had to encounter a winter
of such unmitigated severity as the present. Dead rooks, blackbirds,
chaffinches, and hedge sparrows are only too common in copse, hedgerow,
and open field, stiffened and starved all of them, nothing but the
bones, skin, and feathers remaining as you take them up and handle
them, so that one only wonders how it is they did not drop and die long
before reaching such a sad state of utter fleshlessness and emaciation.
A whole month, however, of intense frost, making every one exposed to
its direct influence, even for a moment, put their fingers to their
mouths with a &ldquo;poor Tom&rsquo;s a-cold&rdquo; attitude and
grin&mdash;of intense frost, in which the earth became hard and
resonant as iron, clearly accounts for it all. Some idea of the
keenness of the frost at times may be gathered from the following
facts:&mdash;On Friday afternoon we had occasion to go to look if our
boat on the beach was all right, for the darkening heavens threatened
an immediate storm, a not uncommon end to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>such rare
meteorological phenomena as long continued frosts on the West Coast.
Sitting on the end of a log of wood that lay on the beach, a little
above high-water mark, was a rook or crow, which, as we approached,
attempted to fly away, but could not. It stretched itself, and
strained, and flapped its wings frantically as we drew near, but there
it was, tethered firm and fast, manifestly unable to budge an inch,
unless it carried the immense log bodily along with it. We wondered for
a moment what in the world could be the matter, for we could not
recollect ever seeing a rook, of all our birds the most knowing,
perhaps, and self-possessed, act so absurdly. Running forward and
laying hold of the bird, we had a ready solution of the mystery in the
fact that the poor, struggling creature&rsquo;s feet were firmly frozen
to the log&mdash;more firmly than the best bird-lime or glue could have
held them. Thawing the frozen feet with some little trouble by the
warmth of our hand, we had the pleasure of setting the poor bird at
liberty. He&mdash;for it was a male&mdash;did not certainly weigh more,
as we poised him in our hand, than six or seven ounces, though the
ordinary weight of a rook in fair condition is nearly a couple of
pounds. Even within doors the frost was unusually intense. In a small
room off our own kitchen&mdash;and in the latter there is, of course,
always a fire, and generally a large fire, burning&mdash;the
night&rsquo;s milk was frequently found frozen into a hard and solid
mass in the morning; so thoroughly frozen that the servant girl could,
by tilting up the vessel and smartly tapping its bottom get the solid
contents of frozen milk into her hand, and carry it, for the amusement
of the youngsters, about the house, from one room to another, as if it
were a Dunlop cheese. Such a frost we have not had on the West Coast
for at least a score of years. Our wild-bird levee of a morning is a
most interesting scene&mdash;the most pleasant episode, perhaps, in the
necessarily dull routine of a winter&rsquo;s day in the country. On
these occasions we can depend on the presence of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>such
birds as redbreasts, wrens, finches of all kinds, the lively and
ubiquitous chaffinch, however, being most numerous; coral-billed
blackbirds, shy at first, but easily made familiar and friendly enough;
ox-eye tits, very pretty birds, but nervous and fidgety always; house
and hedge sparrows, with a self-assertion and impudence that is most
amusing, and a bold familiarity that would always place them in the
front rank of bread-crumb recipients, if the redbreasts, seldom
otherwise than quarrelsome and testy, did not drive them back. Most of
those birds, when they found an open door or window, would boldly
venture into the house, and eagerly pick up the bread crumbs from off
the floor or table, undisturbed by anything one said or did, provided
only you refrained from any attempt to lay hold of them; in that case
they were off and out instantly, and in a manifest pet at your rudeness
and inhospitality, shy to trust you again until the matter was
forgotten, or perhaps only overlooked perforce of the inexorable logic
of intense cold and gnawing hunger. All the birds that we have handled
for more than a month past were but the merest skin and bone, emaciated
to a degree altogether unknown in less severe winters. Curiously
enough, however, we had a brace of woodcocks a few days ago which were
as plump and fat as one could wish them; and some brace of snipe, shot
in the neighbourhood of Inverness, kindly sent to us as a Christmas
present, were in excellent condition, and good in every way. Why these
long-billed, sucking birds should be fat, when all other birds are
unnaturally lean, is to be accounted for by the fact that the intense
frost drives the worms and minute animals which constitute their food
into the open &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; and rivulets, which never freeze, like
sheep in a fank; and thus the woodcock and snipe have their food with
rather less trouble in frost than in more open weather. Some ten days
ago, a very fine specimen of the jay (<i lang="la">Corvus
glandarius</i>, Linn.; the <i>Scriachan-Coille</i> of the Gael) was
sent us. This is one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span>of our handsomest birds, and we are glad to
say that it has within recent years <span class="corr" id="xd26e6962"
title="Source: becoming">become</span> comparatively common in
Lochaber. Like its congener the magpie, it is looked upon with
considerable suspicion as an enemy to game; eating up, it is alleged,
grouse, and partridge, and pheasant eggs as a favourite <i lang=
"fr">bonne bouche</i>, and even devouring the newly hatched young. It
is a shy and solitary bird, even where it is common, and we do not know
its habits and economy sufficiently to entitle us, much as we are
inclined, to enter on its defence under such an indictment; but, from
all we have been enabled to gather on the subject, we should meantime
be disposed to record the <i lang="la">tertium quid</i> verdict of

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">How intense was the recent frost [January 1875], and
how hyperborean all our surroundings, may be judged of from the fact
that on coming out of church yesterday, one of our people, a
greyheaded, pious old man, spoke of the happy change to open weather
and &ldquo;westlan&rsquo; breezes&rdquo; very solemnly as &ldquo;the
blessed thaw&rdquo;&mdash;<i lang="gd">an t&rsquo;aiteamh
beannaichte</i>. Before any one else north or south of the Tweed made
any reference to the coming winter, our readers may remember that we
did, and that we inculcated on every one the wisdom of keeping
themselves warm and comfortable, by means of good fires and otherwise,
as the best way of being jolly in the best and truest sense of that
much misapprehended and frequently misapplied term. It was, in truth, a
trying season; but sensibly and thickly clad in many a fold of honest
home-spun <i>c&ugrave;rain</i>, or plaiding, our people for the most
part got over it without any very serious ailments. Influenzas,
catarrhs, and colds in every form were of course common, and, for a
time, one was met on every side by an uncomfortable and sometimes
disagreeable amount of coughing, expectoration, sniftering, sneezing,
and nose-blowing; but now all this has almost or altogether passed
away, and people are again going about as usual, clad no otherwise than
ordinarily, and as becometh the inhabitants of a temperate zone:
plaids, comforters, double-ply mittens, and
&ldquo;bosom-friends,&rdquo; having been laid aside as unnecessary
incumbrances in weather that is now actually warm <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>and
spring-like, as compared with that dreadful month or six weeks of
Baffin&rsquo;s Bay-like temperature, that, when it got fairly at you,
and off your guard, seemed capable of making the very blood freeze in
one&rsquo;s veins, even as it froze the water in our subterranean and
best guarded lead pipes. Nothing, perhaps, could more pointedly
illustrate the healthy vigour and vitality of our people generally than
the fact that, although we have amongst us many who have arrived at
extreme old age, and some who have been more or less valetudinarian for
years, there has not been a single death in the district&mdash;a
district which, as we look around us, contains some two or three
thousand inhabitants&mdash;since the beginning of last December; a fact
which, considering the inclemency of the weather, and the high
death-rate everywhere else, is something surely worthy chronicling. We
are probably correct in believing that the worst at least of winter is
already past, but much cold and stormy weather may be still in store
for us, and as colds and coughs may return, we beg to make friendly
offer of the following <i lang="la">probatum est</i> recipe, quite a
popular cure in this part of the country for every form of winter
influenza. Cure or no cure, the recipe has at all events the merit of
being extremely simple, and to thousands of our readers very readily
available at any time. Take a pint&mdash;say a tumblerful&mdash;of sea
water that has been heated to the boiling-point, without having been
allowed actually to boil. Sprinkle over it some pepper, rather more
plentifully than you do in your soup; drink this as hot as you can bear
it as you step into bed at night. Next day your cold and cough will
have disappeared like an unpleasant dream. You may be weak, but you
will, upon the whole, be well! We cannot personally vouch for the
efficacy of this draught, but we find that many people here invariably
resort to it as a ready and popular cure for their colds, and they
speak highly of its virtues, and, contrary to what one would expect, of
its comparative pleasantness and palatability <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>as
well. A sensible old man whom we questioned on the subject a few days
ago, and a firm believer in the efficacy of this &ldquo;saline&rdquo;
draught, told us in confidence that the <i>rationale</i> of the thing
consisted in the fact that it immediately acted as a powerful
sudorific; and that to this, he thought, was to be attributed the
thoroughness as well as the rapidity of the cure. Probably he was
right. It is a simple, cheap, and readily available remedy at all
events, and dwellers by the sea-side might do worse than give it a
trial at a pinch, when more orthodox remedies have failed, or are not
ready to hand. One grand thing about it is the certainty that, if it
does no good, it cannot possibly do harm. Another old man in our
neighbourhood, still hale and active, though in his eighty-fourth year,
told us lately that he never took a dose, not a ha&rsquo;penny&rsquo;s
worth, of medicine, druggist&rsquo;s or doctor&rsquo;s stuff in his
life. &ldquo;Whenever I felt out of sorts,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;I just went down to the sea and drank a good large draught of
salt water; <i>that</i> was always <i>my</i> medicine, and it never
once failed to do me good.&rdquo; So that there may be more virtue in
sea water as a curative agent in bronchial and stomachic ailments than
the world generally wots. And if so, how consoling the thought that
<i>this</i> druggist&rsquo;s shop is never shut; the supply is
exhaustless, and no charge!</p>
<p>A curious bit of popular superstition is the following, which a
gentleman in a neighbouring district was good enough to bring recently
under our notice. After breakfast, at which, among other good things,
we had some excellent fresh eggs, he suggested that we should go into
the kitchen to smoke, &ldquo;and watch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what my
housekeeper will do with the empty egg-shells as the breakfast things
are brought up from the parlour.&rdquo; We went and stood and watched
accordingly, and this is what we saw, chatting with our host the while,
that the housekeeper might not suspect that we took any particular
interest in her doings. We noticed that when the girl came into the
kitchen and laid the tray upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275"
href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>the table, the housekeeper, a
staid and respectable-looking woman, well advanced in years, walked
over and took the egg-shells&mdash;there were four or five of
them&mdash;and, placing them one after another into an egg-cup, she
took a small knife, and passed it with a smart tap through the bottoms
or hitherto unbroken ends of the lot, and then turned away to some
other employment. This was all, for our host immediately suggested that
we should visit the stables. We were a good deal puzzled, having seen
so little, where we expected to have seen a great deal, and that little
so seemingly without meaning and purposeless. When we got to the
stables, our host asked if we understood the meaning of the old
lady&rsquo;s manner of dealing with the egg-shells. We confessed our
profound ignorance, having never seen&mdash;never, at least, seen so as
seriously to notice&mdash;anything of this kind before. &ldquo;My
housekeeper, you must know,&rdquo; continued our friend, &ldquo;is a
most excellent woman, but much given to little superstitious
observances and harmless <i lang="gd">giosragan</i>. She will not allow
a single egg-shell to go out of her sight without first making a hole
through it, knocking out its bottom in short, in case, as she has more
than once seriously told me, a witch should get hold of it and use it
as a boat, in which to set to sea in order to raise violent storms, in
which the ablest seamanship could not possibly save hundreds of vessels
from being miserably wrecked!&rdquo; &ldquo;You may smile,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;for it is supremely absurd, to be sure, that an
otherwise sensible woman should give credence to such nonsense; but,
after all, if you make inquiry, you will find that the superstition in
question is quite a common one. Few middle-aged women, brought up in
the Highlands, but will act as you saw my housekeeper act with the
empty egg-shells, knocking a hole through their unbroken ends before
throwing them aside, or frequently even more effectually providing
against the possibility of their being used as witched life-boats, by
crushing the whole shell into a crumpled mass bodily in the
hand.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>We haven&rsquo;t as yet had many opportunities
of making inquiry into the matter, but from all we can gather from some
old women in our neighbourhood, we believe empty egg-shells are, or
perhaps we should say were, frequently treated after the fashion
stated, and for the reason assigned. Some of our readers in the
north-west Highlands and Hebrides may perhaps know something more about
a very odd and curious superstition to be met with in the latter half
of the nineteenth century. For obvious reasons, it is a superstition
more likely to be prevalent among islanders and dwellers by the
sea-shore than in the more inland parts of the country.</p>
<p>The following fragment of a curious old poem we picked up about ten
days ago from the recitation of Alexander Maclachlan, shepherd,
Dalness. It is unfortunately but a fragment, as we have said, but we
give it here in the hope that some of our friends of the Gaelic
Society, or of our many readers throughout the Hebrides, may be able to
supply more or less of the remainder. Maclachlan heard the entire poem
from a Glenetive forester, a very old man, some years ago, but this man
is now unfortunately dead, and the reciter could not direct us to any
one likely to be able to repeat the poem at length. Perhaps our friend
Mr. J. F. Campbell of Islay, so indefatigable and marvellously
successful in his search after Celtic song and story, &ldquo;all of the
olden time,&rdquo; may have met with it in a more or less complete
form; if so, he would very much oblige us all in the north by giving us
a version of it and its history, as far as he knows it. We may state
that it does not appear in <i lang="gd">Leabhar-na-Feinne</i>, which we
have searched for it, though unquestionably a production of
considerable antiquity. Maclachlan told us that the old forester, in
reciting it, called it <i lang="gd">Conaltradh nan Ian</i>, or <i>The
Parliament of Birds</i>. The following were evidently the opening lines
of the poem, and likeliest to be remembered by one who only heard it
repeated once or twice:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277"

<p>This curious poem seems to have been throughout of a dramatic form.
Maclachlan says that, as he heard it repeated, almost all our better
known wild-birds were introduced, and had appropriate speeches and
parts assigned to them. He particularly referred to a very funny speech
by the wren, who finally quarrels with the wagtail, by whom he had been
insulted, and gives him a good licking. The end of it all is that the
eagle is unanimously elected king of birds, with the glas-eun or
falcon-kite as his lieutenant. The throstle cock is elected bard of
birds, and the dipper admiral and commander-in-chief of the wild-bird
fleet. Any one recovering the whole poem would be conferring no small
boon on Gaelic literature. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; a famous Labrador Dog&mdash;As a
Water-Dog&mdash;His intelligence&mdash;Takes to
Sheep-stealing&mdash;Death!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a recent number of <i>Land and Water</i>, Mr. Frank
Buckland, in writing about the <i lang="la">Ophiophagus elaps</i>, a
serpent-eating serpent lately introduced into the Zoological Gardens,
London, with all the honours due to a visitor so choice and curious in
its diet, remarks that &ldquo;the saying that &lsquo;Dog will not eat
dog&rsquo; is proverbial amongst us.&rdquo; North of the Tweed, neither
in Gaelic nor in guid braid Scotch, is any such proverb known. The
nearest approach to it that we can think of at this moment [April 1875]
is the saying that &ldquo;Hawks winna pick oot hawks&rsquo; een,&rdquo;
and this is applied in a sense very different from that suggested by
Mr. Buckland&rsquo;s proverb, if such a proverb exists. At all events
the saying that dog will not eat dog is not true; dog will eat dog,
ravenously and greedily enough, when he is hungry and gets the chance.
Notwithstanding his domestication and long acquaintance with the usages
of civilised life, the dog is, under certain circumstances, as thorough
a cannibal and savage as ever was Fiji islander in the days when that
worthy Polynesian would give the best finger of his right hand for a
prime haunch of full-fed and fat &ldquo;missionary.&rdquo; Out of many
instances that had come under our own observation of cannibalism in
dogs, take the following, all the circumstances connected with which,
although it is somewhat of an old story now, are for many reasons as
fresh in our recollection as if they had occurred but yesterday. When
we came to Lochaber, upwards of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>twenty years ago (<i lang=
"la">Eheu! fugaces labuntur anni</i>), we had a large Labrador dog, a
present, when a three-months-old pup, from one of the best and
kindliest men we have ever known, the late Rev. Dr. Macnair, of the
Abbey Church, Paisley. He grew to be a magnificent animal, the largest
and most powerful dog, perhaps, ever seen in the Highlands, and as
sagacious and good-tempered as he was big and bold and strong. The late
Mr. Campbell of Monzie, an excellent judge of dogs, used to say that he
was the finest dog he ever saw, and made it a point every year to call
once or twice during the shooting season purposely to have &ldquo;a
friendly talk,&rdquo; as he termed it, with &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; for
such was our canny Goliath&rsquo;s name. As a water-dog, he was simply
perfect, as amphibious almost as a seal. Any stone that you took in
your hand and threw into twelve, fifteen, or even twenty feet of water,
he instantly dashed after, and took from the bottom, and laid at your
feet, seldom making a mistake, though how he was able to select from a
stony bottom the very stone that had been handled and thrown in by you
was then, and is still, a puzzle to us: not by scent, one would think,
for all traces of contact with the hand must surely have been lost in
passing through such a depth of salt water. He probably was able to
recognise the proper stone partly from its colour and shape, and from
its being in a less saturated state, and less in contact with the
bottom than were those that always lay there. On one occasion we had
left our boat on the beach, neglecting to tie the painter, as we
intended returning immediately. Something came in the way, however,
that occupied us longer than we expected, and on returning to the
shore, our boat was off and away, drifting before a land breeze that
had already carried it quite a quarter of a mile from the beach. There
was no other boat at hand in which to overtake the runaway, and to go
round by the ferry, to meet it on the opposite side of the loch, was a
longer walk than one cared about just then, and the boat, besides, was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>likely to be considerably damaged if it reached
the rocks on the other side, as the chances were it would, before we
could arrive. While thus in a state of anxiety and indecision, our eye
fell upon &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; then our constant companion, afloat and
ashore. &ldquo;Albert, old fellow,&rdquo; we remarked, &ldquo;the boat,
you see, is adrift; what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; With a grand, deep
bass bark in response, he dashed into the water, and ere we could well
understand it all, he was a hundred yards away, swimming hastily and
rapidly in the direction of the truant yawl. We could only sit down on
a rock to watch and wait the upshot of the adventure. Soon overtaking
the runaway boat, &ldquo;Albert&rdquo; swam once or twice round it, and
then observing that the painter was dragging in the water over the bow,
he seized the rope in his mouth, and strongly and steadily towed the
boat towards us, against a stiff breeze and a considerable ripple of a
sea, until he reached the beach, and dropped the painter on the shingle
at our feet, and with a jolly, self-approving bark, in response to our
words of hearty welcome, that made the mountain echoes ring again, he
shook a perfect shower-bath of brine from his shaggy coat, and
scampered away along the sands to dry himself. He was manifestly proud,
as he well ought to be, of an exploit so timeously and sagaciously
performed, and so, be sure, were we. &ldquo;Albert&rsquo;s&rdquo;
readiness to take to the water was, on one occasion at least, attended
by rather awkward circumstances. One beautiful summer afternoon, a
young Oxford friend and ourselves were in the same boat, with
&ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; as usual, for a companion. It was too calm for
sailing, and we were too lazy to row, so we allowed the boat to drift
about at &ldquo;its own sweet will,&rdquo; while we lounged on the
thwarts and read the papers, of special interest then on account of the
Crimean war. We were half a mile from land, and our friend by-and-by
suggested that a swim in the invitingly cool, clear sea would be a good
thing before returning home to dinner. As he was an excellent swimmer,
with whom, for a small wager, we had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>the day before done a
considerable distance, we readily agreed. We had long known, however,
how difficult it is to get into a buoyant, floating boat of such a
comparatively small size as ours was, without any purchase to aid but
such as is afforded by the unstable water, and it was arranged that he
should have his dip first, and when he was tired of it, and we had
helped him on board, that we should have a plunge in our turn.
&ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; who had not been consulted in our arrangement,
was stretched the while at length, half or wholly asleep, along the
bottom of the boat. When he had stripped, our young friend stood up in
the bow, with one foot on the foremost thwart and the other on the
gunwale, and with a loud shout took a splendid header into the cool,
green depths, disappearing like an arrow, with a clean, clear cut, that
hardly left a ripple on the surface. &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; who clearly
thought it an accident, and that the young man&rsquo;s life was in
danger, with one brave bound, and before we could prevent him, was
instantly over the side, and, diving after the swimmer, met him as he
was returning to the surface, and laid hold of him awkwardly, though
with the best intention, by the fleshy part of the left arm near the
shoulder. When they appeared on the surface, the swimmer, who had
manifestly lost all his self-possession, struggled violently to free
himself from the dog, and would certainly have been drowned by his own
struggles and the very exertions intended by the noble animal to save
his life, if we had not quickly rowed the boat alongside, and taking
our friend very unceremoniously by his &ldquo;Hyperion curls,&rdquo;
dragged him on board, panting and sputtering as only the half-drowned
and wholly frightened can pant and sputter in such circumstances. On
examination, his arm was found to be less hurt by the dog&rsquo;s teeth
than we expected it to be; a firm and friendly grip with such kindly
intentions as actuated the honest would-be rescuer being a very
different thing from a bite and worry in good earnest. His back and
shoulders, however, were seriously scratched <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>in
livid lash-like weals by the dog&rsquo;s nails, while they were hugging
each other and struggling in the water. &ldquo;Albert&rdquo; was of
course very little if at all to blame in the adventure, and his only
punishment&mdash;if what indeed was to him always a delight could be
called a punishment&mdash;was that, refusing to take him back into the
boat, he was obliged to swim a full half mile to the beach; which,
however, he easily reached before us. Our friend felt sore and
uncomfortable for a day or two, but was soon all right again; and both
he and we had got a lesson which we were not likely to forget in a
hurry, that a powerful dog, no matter how well meaning and kindly his
intentions, is rather a dangerous companion to a swimmer <i lang=
"la">in puris naturalibus</i> in deep water.</p>
<p>But what has all this, it may be asked, to do with Mr. Frank
Buckland and his proverb that &ldquo;Dog will not eat dog&rdquo;? A
little patience, as is your wont, courteous reader, and we shall come
to the point without much more ado. When &ldquo;Albert&rdquo; was about
four years old, and as powerful, and perfect, and pleasant a dog as
ever growled in anger or barked with glee, it began to be rumoured
abroad that he was fast falling into bad habits&mdash;whether from
following evil example, or instinctively and <i lang="la">proprio
mot&ucirc;</i>, was never determined. He was accused, in fact, of
sheep-worrying, and of course we couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t
believe a bit of it. Other dogs might be guilty of such vulgar
misconduct; in the case of our dog the thing was impossible.
Wasn&rsquo;t he regularly and well fed? Didn&rsquo;t he sleep every
night at our own bedroom door? All this, of course, we said, and urged,
and argued, and furthermore we urged a fact which seemed to us to be
conclusive of our dog&rsquo;s innocence of the great misdemeanour laid
to his charge&mdash;we had sheep of our own, and there were sheep
belonging to others in our immediate neighbourhood, and with none of
these, we pointed out, had our dog ever been known to make or meddle in
any way further than by an occasional deep <i>bow-wow!</i> which,
though it sometimes made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href=
"#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>them scamper, was uttered more in
rollicking fun and merry make-believe than in anything like anger or
earnest. Precisely so, answered a host of crook-carrying shepherds from
farms five, seven, ten miles away: &ldquo;Your dog is too knowing to
kill sheep at your own doors; he goes to a considerable distance on his
raids, the better to escape detection, slipping away at night or early
in the morning unknown to you, and returning as innocent-seeming as the
last sheep he has worried, before you appear in your breakfast
parlour!&rdquo; It was not alleged that he had ever been caught in the
act, or actually seen eating forbidden mutton or lamb, <i>minus</i> the
&ldquo;mint sauce;&rdquo; but more than one shepherd averred that he
had more than once been seen wandering at improper hours on hill-sides,
where he had no good right or reason to be, on which occasions, too, he
exhibited the stealthy, prowling pace, and all the hang-dog looks and
other signs of an evil-doer. Half afraid that it was too true, but
irritated by their strenuousness of assertion, and defiant to the last,
&ldquo;Catch him, then!&rdquo; we exclaimed, &ldquo;shoot him, kill
him, if he is harming you; but I am not going to put away or kill my
dog&mdash;and such a dog, too! worth the best <i>hirsel</i> in your
charge!&mdash;simply to please you.&rdquo; And thus the matter rested
for a time, but not for long. Early one Monday morning, about a
fortnight afterwards, our good neighbour Mr. Linton, of the farm of
Coruanan, seven or eight miles away, drove up to our door in his gig,
and asked to see us. After the usual civilities, &ldquo;Your big dog is
killing my sheep, Mr. S.!&rdquo; was the charge, straightforward and
unqualified. We argued, of course, that it couldn&rsquo;t be, &amp;c.,
as above, but Mr. Linton soon brought the matter to a very practical
issue. &ldquo;What is the value of your dog?&rdquo; We couldn&rsquo;t
say; he was very valuable, a great favourite, and we declined to put a
price upon him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Mr. Linton, &ldquo;say
that he is worth &pound;5, or &pound;10, or &pound;20. I charge him
with killing two of my sheep this very morning. I have my gun here
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>in the gig: let me shoot him, and if I
don&rsquo;t find and show you wool and mutton-flesh taken from his
stomach, I will gladly pay over the dog&rsquo;s price; if I show you
what I am certain I can show, his still undigested morning meal of
mutton-flesh and wool, we are quits. That&rsquo;s surely fair!&rdquo;
And there was no denying that it was perfectly fair, but we declined,
nevertheless, bringing the matter to the arbitrament suggested. We
parted good friends, however, for we promised that whether he was to be
shot or drowned, or sent out of the country, the dog would never again
be allowed a chance of killing another sheep in Lochaber, and our
friend Mr. Linton is, we are glad to say, still in life to bear
testimony to the fact that we were as good as our word. On due
consideration of the case in all its aspects, we decided that it was
best, in the interest of peace and good neighbourhood, to have the dog
shot forthwith, and shot he was accordingly within an hour of the
interview above described. We directed the executioner of the sad
sentence to open him, that we might examine the contents of the
stomach, and sure enough, intermixed with wool enough to stuff a small
cushion, it was found to contain many pounds of recently killed and
undigested mutton. It was clear that some at least of the many grave
charges against him were true. Anxious to preserve the skin for
stuffing, the eviscerated body was placed in the fork of an apple tree
in the garden, until we could procure the services of some one expert
in flaying to do the job handsomely. Next morning, on going into the
garden to have a look at all that remained of poor
&ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; what was our astonishment and horror at finding
the <i lang="la">corpus vile</i>&mdash;<i lang="la">vile</i>, indeed,
at last!&mdash;dragged from the tree to the ground, and almost entirely
devoured by some half-dozen jackal looking curs, that were having what
was manifestly to them a jolly banquet on the remains of the gallant
animal whose single bark when in lusty life was sufficient to scatter a
whole score of such sorry mongrels, as if each had a firebrand at his
tail. Except a few ragged shreds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285"
href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>of skin and the larger bones,
they had devoured every particle of him; and so much for Mr. Frank
Buckland and his proverb that &ldquo;Dog will not eat dog.&rdquo;
Won&rsquo;t he just, when he has the chance! Nor is this by any means
the only instance of canine cannibalism that might be adduced from our
common-place book in disproof of any proverb or saying whatever to the
contrary. Poor &ldquo;Albert!&rdquo; we are ashamed to confess how much
grieved we were for his death, his ovicidal tendencies notwithstanding.
His upper jaw, showing a development of dentition of which a Bengal
tiger need not have been ashamed, is the only relic of our gallant dog
now remaining to us; and on the <i lang="la">ex pede Herculem</i>
principle, we point to that with a melancholy satisfaction in telling
how big and brave, afloat and ashore, was our matchless Labrador.

<div class="argument">
<p class="first">An old Fingalian Hero&mdash;His keenness of Sight and
sharpness of Ear&mdash; Foresters and
Keepers&mdash;Foxhunters&mdash;Donald MacDonald&mdash;His
Dogs&mdash;Sandy MacArthur the Mole-catcher.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The hero of one of our most popular old Fingalian
tales is described as very marvellously gifted. In order to secure the
hand of a beautiful Scandinavian princess, whose locks are as the beams
of the setting sun, about the time the summer sea is flecked and barred
with gold, and with whom he has long been in love, he has to undertake
the most strange and startling adventures; and not the least important
of his qualifications for combating the frequent difficulties of his
position is a preternatural acuteness of eye and ear, of sight and
hearing. His keenness of sight, for instance, is indicated by his being
able to count the beats of the swallow&rsquo;s wings in all the
gyrations of its flight over the summer grove; and as for his acuteness
of ear, enough is said when the veracious chronicler does not hesitate
to assert that his hero could hear the grass grow? We, in our unheroic
and degenerate day, cannot boast of anything like this. We are content
to know that the swallow skims the pool with a swiftness due to a
motion of wing too rapid to be detected in its separate beats by the
acutest eye, and that the grass does grow, and at times with marvellous
rapidity, albeit the stir and tumult of its upward rush is inaudible to
human ears. But if we cannot <i>hear</i> the grass grow, we can safely
aver that in such exceptionally splendid seasons as this [July 1875],
and without fear of being charged with any very culpable exaggeration,
we can <i>see</i> it grow, not only from day to day, but almost
literally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>from hour to hour&mdash;so rapid, so marked, and
visibly perceptible is the progress towards a large and lusty maturity
of grass and grain and every green herb of the field. Anything, indeed,
to equal the sturdy vigour and upward rush of vegetation during the
month of June last past we never did see before, and had it not come
immediately under our own observation, we could hardly have believed it
possible anywhere outside the tropics. The harvest must necessarily be
a late one, though not quite so late as it was at one time feared must
be the case. If we say that the season of ingathering will be later
than usual by ten days, or a fortnight at the most, we are probably not
far from the mark. But, late or early, it is sure to be an exceedingly
abundant harvest, there being at present all over the West Highlands
every promise of very heavy returns, the heaviest, perhaps, that, under
any circumstances whatever, the land could safely bear, with the hope
of an eventually fully ripe and lusty maturity.</p>
<p>Readers of our <i>Nether Lochaber</i> papers will in nowise be
surprised to hear that we have all our lifetime made it a point to
cultivate the confidence and friendly goodwill of keepers, foresters,
and their followers, wherever we chanced to meet with them; nor would
it be proper to suppress our grateful acknowledgment of the fact that
to them we have been largely indebted in all our zoological studies for
a long quarter of a century. We look upon foresters and gamekeepers as
at the head of their profession, what the French call &ldquo;princes of
the game,&rdquo; and we have ever found them exceedingly courteous and
kind, highly intelligent almost without exception, and not merely
willing but well pleased to be examined, and cross-examined when
occasion calls, on anything and everything appertaining to, or at all
connected with, their office. With their humbler brethren of the craft,
too, we have long been thoroughly <i lang="fr">en rapport</i>; these
humbler brethren being the fox-hunters, mole-catchers, and
vermin-killers generally, by whatever name or designation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>known from the Moray Firth, to the Clyde. Most
readers of poetry will remember how Pope, in one of his finest poems
(<i>Prologue</i> to the <i>Satires</i>), apostrophises his friend Dr.
Arbuthnot as</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Friend to my life! which did not you
prolong,</p>
<p class="line">The world had wanted many an idle song.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And if one dared to parody any couplet from a poem so
beautiful, we should be disposed to address the first fox-hunter or
mole-catcher of our numerous acquaintances among them who are deacons
of their craft, we chanced to meet, in some such words as
these&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Friend to my mill! which did not you supply</p>
<p class="line">With frequent <i>grist</i>, I&rsquo;d wither, wane, and
die.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A few days ago the Ardgour fox-hunter, Donald
Macdonald by name, a Moidart man, and an excellent specimen of his
class, called upon us with his quarterly budget of news from glen and
upland, from hill and scaur, and den and corrie; and a wonderful season
in his particular line he vows it has been. Since the middle of April
last he has killed and bagged no fewer than <i>fifty-one</i> foxes all
told, besides a number, both young and old, that were worried to the
death by his terriers in the deepest recesses of their <i>saobhies</i>
or dens, whence, when the turmoil of battle had ceased, and his dogs
had emerged bearing very visible marks of the deadly conflict within,
it was impossible to dig them out. All these foxes were got on the
borders of three conterminous farms&mdash;Aryhuelan (Dr.
Simpson&rsquo;s), Conaglen and Inverscaddle (the Earl of
Morton&rsquo;s), and Glennahuirich (Mr. Milligan&rsquo;s). Donald, who
has been a fox-hunter for upwards of thirty years, never before knew
foxes so numerous, and this not in one or more favourite haunts within
a given district, but generally over the country. He couldn&rsquo;t
himself in any way satisfactorily account for the fox fecundity of
1874&ndash;75, and we could only regret that we were unable to
enlighten him in the least, for he avowedly came for enlightenment on a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>subject that was very naturally exceedingly
interesting to him. We were obliged to confess that the matter was as
much a puzzle to us as to himself, but promised to think it over.
Account for it as we may, it is in truth a fact that has attracted
attention everywhere, that not for many years, if indeed ever before,
have foxes been so numerous all over the Highlands. In the three
adjoining districts of Badenoch, Lochaber, and Ardgour, the last
including a part of Sunart, we are assured that no less a number than
<i>two hundred and forty-three</i> foxes have been killed or captured
since mid-April, besides, as already stated, a considerable number
worried in the recesses of their big rock dens which could not be
actually &ldquo;bagged&rdquo; or charged for after the fashion of the
craft by brush or pad, though there was no doubt at all of their having
succumbed after, in each case, a more or less desperate battle, to the
assaults of their terrier assailants. And here, good reader, you must
permit us, <i lang="fr">en parenthese</i>, a slight disgression, not
altogether, we hope, uninteresting. We wonder if in the great family of
dogs anywhere throughout the world there is anything to equal in
hardihood, pluck, and all endurance the Highland fox-hunter&rsquo;s
canine following? They are invariably a rough and ragged lot enough,
and seemingly at sixes and sevens as to anything like assortment; no
two of them exactly alike in colour, size, or breed; and they are
usually low in stature, though of considerable bone and well developed
muscle what there is of it; but be what they may in these respects,
when you fall in with one of our fox-hunter&rsquo;s packs, six, seven,
eight, or a dozen in number, as the case may be, be sure you have
before you the gamest, <i>varmintest</i> little beggars to tackle
otter, fox, or badger that the whole world can show. Our visitor of the
other day had only one little fellow of his pack along with him.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name, Donald?&rdquo; we asked, pointing to his
wiry follower, that we could easily see was, from the ink-black tip of
his nose to the extremity of his tail, a &ldquo;varmint&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>of the first order. &ldquo;What do you call
him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Speach,&rdquo; he replied, and <i>speach</i>, our
non-Gaelic readers must be told, means a wasp or hornet, and, even like
a wasp, we knew that that little fellow with his dander up in the
labyrinthine recesses of a fox&rsquo;s den or a badger&rsquo;s
<i>garaidh</i>, would fight against any odds until he was torn into
ribbons, and on each and every occasion would prove himself</p>

smallest, indeed, at present in my pack, but he will take hold of fox
or badger or otter at the readiest spot that offers, and, having once
got hold, will never let go again while his antagonist is in life;
<i>at every dig only burying his muzzle deeper into his
opponent</i>.&rdquo; We quite agreed with him that a dog that did
<i>that</i> must be good indeed; and we are perfectly satisfied that he
did not in the least exaggerate the indomitable pluck and never-say-die
tenacity of his tiny favourite. Two very good things remain to be said
in praise of our Highland fox-hunters&rsquo; dogs. They are never known
to bite, and very rarely even to bark at human beings; and no
fox-hunter&rsquo;s dog was ever known to be affected with hydrophobia
or canine madness. The exemption from canine madness may, perhaps, be
largely due to their open air and natural mode of life, but it is
difficult to understand why they should be so entirely free from any
propensity to bite or otherwise annoy a human being, a vice common
enough to dogs of unexceptionable character and breeding otherwise, and
from which even the highly intelligent and much-lauded <i>collie</i> is
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>no means so free as his many admirers seem to
suppose. Even a collie is always prepared to bark, and oftentimes to
bite on very little provocation, or no provocation at all. The
fox-hunter&rsquo;s terrier, whether he is pure or a nondescript cross,
very rarely indeed barks at a stranger, and never under any
circumstances offers to bite. We question if there is a human being
to-day in life who can honestly assert that he has ever been bitten by
a fox-hunter&rsquo;s dog. With Macdonald we had a long and interesting
crack, in the course of which we touched on some matters of sufficient
importance to be introduced to the reader on a future occasion.</p>
<p>We had also a visit some little time ago from Sandy Macarthur, a
well-known mole-catcher in Lochaber and the neighbouring districts; a
very intelligent and civil man, whose only fault is that when you have
collared him there is no spontaneity in his crack. Even when you have
got firm hold enough of him, you have to extract his frequently very
valuable information from him by a process akin to that which an
ingenious and learned counsel employs in the case of a recalcitrant and
unwilling witness at an important jury trial. Sandy, however, is a good
fellow all the same, slow but sure; and his quiet unobtrusiveness and
reticence is perhaps to be attributed to the exigencies of his
profession; a &ldquo;rattling, roaring Willie&rdquo; of a mole-catcher,
with, to use a Gaelic phrase, his tongue constantly on his shoulder,
would probably prove but an unsuccessful hunter of the velvet-coated
quick-eared, and timid subterranean family of the Mac <i>Talpa</i>.
Sandy, on the contrary, goes to work in dead silence and a-tiptoe, and
bags his mole as quietly as an angler baskets his trout from out the
glassy pool, over which, if but his shadow moved, he would angle long
in vain. Sandy assures us that moles are to be found this season where
they were never seen before, and where he was at first a good deal
puzzled to account for their appearance. On a full <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>consideration of the case Macarthur&rsquo;s
theory is briefly to this effect: Moles are mainly underground
dwellers, and even their travelling and migrating from place to place
are done subterraneously. If, however, they find themselves, as in the
Highlands they must frequently do, in a district or part of district
separated from other parts in which they have never been by rocky spurs
and ridges, they will not venture over these latter unless they carry
sufficient earth to hide their tunnelling, which, it is needless to
say, they frequently do not. The mole in such a case remains insulated,
a prisoner, so to speak, within his present domain. Last winter and
spring, however, according to Sandy&rsquo;s theory, the snow lay so
deep and lay so long, that the moles took advantage of the fact, and
making their tunnels under the snow, where it lay on spur and ridge,
just as if it had been so much superincumbent soil, they easily got
into fresh fields and pastures new. In this way alone can Sandy account
for the appearance of moles this summer in places into which hitherto
they had no means of ready access; and he may be right, though it is a
point in the natural history of the <i>Talpa</i> well deserving further
investigation. Sandy further avers that moles sometimes swim across
rivers, fresh-water lakes, and even arms of the sea in their
migrations; and this is just possible, though we took the liberty of
expressing ourselves slightly incredulous. Sandy, however, ought to
know; he has spent the best part of a life already approaching its
grand climacteric in the careful and close and constant study of, as
one may say, a single animal&mdash;to wit, the mole&mdash;and it is
always hazardous gravely to doubt or contradict the deliberately
expressed opinion of such a man on a matter strictly within his proper
province. All the same we still venture to question the assertion that
the mole ever voluntarily enters water deep enough to swim in, or ever
dims the velvety sheen of its glossy pile even by such a luxury as a
voluntary bath in the shallows, till we have some stronger proof for it
than has yet been adduced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So says the love-sick knight in <i>Venice
Preserved</i>. We have never, much as we should like it, had an
opportunity of enjoying a Rialto midnight meditation ramble. There is
poetry and romance in the very thought of it; but we know something
more poetical and in every way better still, namely, a midnight
meditative stroll along our own beautiful silvery sanded beach, what
time the sea is so calm that its breathings are low and soft as the
respirations of a child whose sleep is undisturbed save by
angel-whispered dreams; the cloudless sky above, with its waning moon
and thousands of sparkling stars, each star a living intelligence; its
sparkling speech, and no sound to disturb the solemn silence, except
now and again the wakeful sea-bird&rsquo;s eerie scream, and the voice
of many waters, as the mountain torrents leap adown their channels to
the sea, a voice so mellowed by the distance that it becomes solemn and
musical as the fast-falling concluding notes of a grand organ
hymn&mdash;the Pentecostal &ldquo;<i lang="la">Veni, Creator
Spiritus</i>, for example. During the fine weather of this
exceptionally fine season [August 1875] we have rarely gone to bed
before midnight, more frequently, indeed, long after, and our last
thing at night has been a sea-shore stroll, a half or quarter hour so
thoroughly enjoyable that we have come to miss it sadly, if by adverse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>weather, absence from home, or any other cause,
we are obliged to forego it. In addition to all the other attractions
of a midnight sea-side stroll in such weather as the tropics themselves
might be proud of, the reader must remember that August is one of our
meteor months&mdash;the second week particularly being remarkable for
the number and brilliancy of the <i>Perseides</i>, so called from their
seeming mainly to radiate from the direction of the constellation
<i>Perseus</i>. Never was there a finer season to observe them than
this; and although they have, perhaps, been less numerous than usual,
the brilliancy of many of them was so remarkable, and their paths
throughout so easily followed, that their very infrequency only added
to the eagerness and interest with which one watched and waited for
them. The finest display of the season was from midnight on to nearly
two <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on the night of the 11th and 12th, in
which time we counted thirty-three <i>noticeable</i> meteors&mdash;of
which seven were what might be called first-class meteors of a nucleus
brilliancy equal to or exceeding that of first magnitude stars, with
broad, bright, well-defined trains, that wholly or in part, in three or
four instances, remained in sight, mapping out the meteor&rsquo;s
trajectory for several seconds after the disappearance or extinction of
the parent orb or meteor proper itself. Mr. W. B. Symington, who was
among the Hebrides at the time on a yachting cruise, writes on the
subject as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Notwithstanding your injunction to be
on the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i> as to the August meteors, I am sorry
to say that I forgot all about it on the nights of the 9th and 10th,
although the weather was beautifully clear. On the 11th, 12th, and
13th, however, the sailing-master and myself were sharply on the
look-out, and our watchfulness was rewarded by the sight of some really
very splendid examples. There were on each night scores and scores of
the more common, lesser, and fainter meteors, but our attention was of
course principally directed to the more brilliant ones. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>Of
these latter we had, during about an hour and a quarter&rsquo;s
observation, four very fine ones, with long bright tails, on the 11th;
nine on the 12th; and one magnificent fellow, that lighted up the deck,
sails, and rigging of the yacht with a strange greenish glare, on the
13th. This last was at 11.5 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> One of the men
said that before daybreak on the 12th there were some very large and
bright meteors. As far as my observations went, the course of these
meteors seemed to be mainly to the west and south-west, although two at
least of the larger ones rushed in a directly opposite path, namely, to
east and north-east. As I am likely to be at sea in November, though in
a very different kind of craft, I will endeavour to give you a more
careful and satisfactory account of the meteor display of that month. I
may tell you that one of the men caught a <i>scad</i> of large size,
the biggest, I believe, I ever saw. It weighed nearly four pounds. I
thought it not bad eating, though the rest of them in the cabin said it
was coarse and tasteless. It was caught by a long line and herring
baited hook, that was allowed to drag after the ship in a breeze that
gave us at the time a speed of at least eight knots an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fish referred to by our correspondent is also called the Spanish
mackerel, it being very common on some parts of the Spanish coast. It
belongs to the order <i lang="la">Scomberid&aelig;</i>, and is a cousin
of our own better known mackerel proper, though a considerably larger
fish, and not nearly so good for the table as its beautiful congener.
The Spanish differs from the mackerel proper in one very remarkable
particular; it has an <i>air bladder</i> which the true mackerel of our
shores has not, and yet the latter is one of the readiest and swiftest
swimmers, and at all depths, of any fish in the sea. The fact is that
the real use of the air bladder in the economy of fish still continues
an unresolved and seemingly an unresolvable puzzle.</p>
<p>Lovers of living, healthy poetry&mdash;healthy as the mountain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>breeze, and free and sparkling as the mountain
stream, and more especially our Celtic friends who have been taught to
honour and reverence the &ldquo;kilted&rdquo; muse&mdash;will be glad
to know that Professor Blackie has in preparation the materials of what
cannot fail to prove a very interesting volume, consisting of
translations of some of the most admired compositions of our modern
Gaelic bards. Macintyre&rsquo;s <i>Ben. Dorain</i>, Alasdair
Macdonald&rsquo;s <i>Berliun</i>, with many of such lesser popular
lyrics, as <i lang="gd">Am Breacan Wallach</i>, <i lang="gd">Failte na
Mor-Thir</i>, <i lang="gd">A Bhanarach Dhoun a Cruidh</i>, &amp;c.,
will thus appear for the first time in a becoming Saxon garb;
not&mdash;to use the milliner&rsquo;s phrase&mdash;too tight a fit,
observe, but natural and easy, though &ldquo;made to measure,&rdquo;
and we venture to predict that our English readers, who as yet know
them not at all, and our Gaelic friends, who know them well and have
long known them, will alike be pleased with the results of the learned
Professor&rsquo;s gallant raid into bard-land. The Professor has been
visiting us here lately, and we can honestly say that such specimens of
his work as he was good enough to read to us&mdash;and there are few
better readers than Professor Blackie&mdash;seemed to us admirably
done. His version of <i>Ben. Dorain</i> particularly, which we had an
opportunity of hearing twice, and of which we can thus speak most
positively, is thoroughly well done; so well, so faithfully, and with
such spirit and <i>verve</i> as must delight not only the ordinary
reader, but the very &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; of the original
author&mdash;Macintyre himself&mdash;if, like the Ossianic departed
heroes, he is permitted to know and appreciate sublunary affairs from
out the bosom of &ldquo;his cloud.&rdquo; The Professor translates
these Gaelic poems into English verse just as, in our opinion, they
should be translated; not too literally, but with all necessary freedom
and elbow room, and yet so literally that any one knowing the English
version may rest assured that he knows also the original quite as
intimately and correctly as it is possible in the circumstances for any
mere outsider <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>to know it. Johnson, in his <i>Life of
Dryden</i>, referring to the latter&rsquo;s version of the
<i>&AElig;neid</i>, &amp;c., has a paragraph which is worth quoting in
this connection:&mdash;&ldquo;When languages are formed upon different
principles, it is impossible that the same modes of expression should
always be elegant in both. While they run on together, the closest
translation may be considered the best; but when they divaricate, each
must take its natural course. Where correspondence cannot be obtained,
it is necessary to be content with something equivalent.
&lsquo;Translation, therefore,&rsquo; says Dryden, &lsquo;is not so
loose as paraphrase, nor so close as metaphrase.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
With all this we entirely concur, more especially when such widely
different languages as the English and Gaelic have to be dealt with. We
do not know that Professor Blackie ever read the paragraph quoted, or,
even if he did read it, that he now remembers it; but to his
translations from the Gaelic, to so much of them, at all events, as
were submitted to our notice, Dryden&rsquo;s dictum is entirely
applicable&mdash;they are not so loose as paraphrase, nor so close as
metaphrase. They strike a golden mean very difficult of attainment in
such efforts; and on the appearance of the volume itself, we shall be
disappointed if nine-tenths at least of the many readers it is sure to
command do not entirely agree with us. But <i lang="fr">nous
verrons</i>, if we live we shall see.</p>
<p>The <i>Transactions</i> of the Gaelic Society of Inverness for
1873&ndash;4 and 1874&ndash;5, have reached us. The Secretary&rsquo;s
paper on &ldquo;Coinneach Odhar,&rdquo; the Brahan seer, is most
interesting, containing as it does the best account that we have met
with of that uncanny Ross-shire worthy. That he was an impostor, and a
vulgar impostor too, there can be no doubt; but the story of a
man&mdash;clever, shrewd rascal as he was&mdash;in whom the people so
thoroughly believed, is worth the telling, and Mr. Mackenzie tells it
very well. He should, we think, give us, if possible, a second paper,
containing the many other wonderful vaticinations attributed to his
hero, who seems to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href=
"#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>latterly been too clever by half;
for he who could foresee the misfortunes of others&mdash;the death even
of a cow&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t evidently foresee the well-merited fate
that awaited himself; for he was hanged, and we have no doubt at all
that he richly deserved that species of exaltation. What Thomas the
Rhymer&mdash;him of Ercildoune&mdash;was in the south of Scotland at a
much earlier period, this <i lang="gd">Coinneach Odhar</i>, comparing
small things with great, seems to have been in the North-West Highlands
during the latter half of the seventeenth century. &ldquo;True
Thomas,&rdquo; however, was a gentleman and a scholar; whereas <i lang=
"gd">Coinneach</i> was, of course, utterly illiterate, conducting his
scheme of imposture solely by the aid of natural talents, which must
have been considerable, and a large and ever-ready stock of impudence
and cunning, nicely calculated to impose upon the vulgar. He made his
grand mistake when he flew at such high game as Lady Seaforth and her
domestic affairs. She was too clever, too intelligent and well-educated
to be imposed upon. She ordered him to be hanged, a doom to which many
were led at that period who probably less richly deserved it than such
a prying, meddling, mischief-maker as was Kenneth the Seer.

Merlin&mdash;Falcon and Tringa.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have had a full fortnight of magnificent summer
weather [August 1875], a bright sun over-head from morning till night,
with brisk breezes, <i lang="gd">a leanachd na gr&eacute;ine</i>,
following the sun; that is, beginning in the morning at east, and
gradually wearing round <i lang="la">pari pass&ucirc;</i> with the
solar march, till at sunset it is north-west, and so on round and round
the compass day after day, a phenomenon usually attendant upon the very
finest weather in our northern latitudes. Under these circumstances it
will not surprise those who care for such matters to hear that our hay
crop, about which we were in such anxiety, has been secured in splendid
condition, in such condition, indeed, as we can rarely boast of in the
West Highlands. Our meadow hay crop, too, is this year unusually heavy,
and already, in obedience to the adage which teaches that it is well
and wise to make one&rsquo;s hay while the sun shines, we are all busy
getting it cut down and secured, although the old, orthodox season is
not yet for a fortnight to come&mdash;about old Lammastide. Oats with
us here are generally a light crop, but it will as such be easier to
secure in good condition than a heavier crop would be, and, upon the
whole, may thus turn out quite as profitable. Potatoes are not so heavy
haulmed as usual, but in other respects they promise well, and there is
no appearance of our old enemy the &ldquo;blight.&rdquo; We hear,
however, a good deal of complaint in some districts on account of the
prevalence this year of yellow shaw, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span><i lang=
"gd">bar-buidhe</i> as our Highlanders term it, the work of a small
grey slug that attacks the main-stem shaw just at its point of junction
with the soil, and eating and tunnelling it through and through until
the leaves first assume a yellow and withered appearance, and the whole
shaw finally falls down paralysed, and practically useless and
inoperative as to its proper functions, though not actually rotten or
dead, as in the case of the &ldquo;blight.&rdquo; Many such shaws in a
field give it an unsightly appearance, but beyond this there is no
great harm done after all, for as the slug seldom begins its work until
the plant is large and well forward, the tubers underground, though
they may be of smaller size than their neighbours that have escaped the
slug&rsquo;s attentions, are yet sound and wholesome food enough either
for man or beast. We have observed that this particular slug, or a
closely allied species, is also much given to feeding on the stem of
the common fern or bracken, dealing with it just as it does with the
potato shaw, though, to be sure, it finds the fern a rather harder nut
to crack; for the brave bracken, with its firmer contexture of stem,
refuses to bend its head to the ground, no matter the number or
direction of the slug&rsquo;s insidious tunnellings and perforations.
If you glance at a fern clump as you ride along the road or climb the
mountain steep, the yellow, withered fronds of an occasional plant,
here and there painfully conspicuous amid the rich, dark, emerald green
of its healthy companions, tell you where the grey slug&mdash;and a
nasty, slimy little wretch it is&mdash;is busy at its evil work,
drinking up, like consumption among the human race, the very
heart&rsquo;s blood, so to speak, of the fairest and finest plants it
can find. We have found in our own experience that the best protection
of the potato from its ravages is to give the ground a sprinkling of
lime just as the plants are appearing above ground, about the end of
April or beginning of May. For the early varieties usually planted in
our gardens, a sprinkling of soot is less unsightly and equally
efficacious with lime. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>And speaking of the bracken, let us observe that, while it is a
magnificent and beautiful plant, it is, like everything else of beauty,
most beautiful in its proper place. Meet it on mountain slope, in
copsewood covert, or greenwood glade, and you cannot admire it
sufficiently. In the end of autumn, particularly when its graceful
fronds have assumed a certain indescribable tinge of mingled brown and
ruby and gold, a bracken covert is beyond measure lovely. At such a
stage, and in the warm and mellow light of the setting September sun,
it is to ourselves all that an ocean of broom in flower was to the
great Linn&aelig;us. If, however, you live in the near neighbourhood of
brackens, you will find that it is apt to creep down from its proper
wild and upland habitat, and to encroach unduly upon your old grass
lands, wherever it can get an undisturbed footing. If you consult books
on the subject, they will tell you that if you cut them down for a
season or two running before they ripen, they will die away and
disappear. With our large, soft-stemmed herbaceous plants, this method
of eradication is sometimes effectual enough; with the bracken, as we
know to our cost, it avails nothing. The roots are so curiously
ramified and intertwined that they will live on and put forth a new
growth year after year, no matter how constantly and closely you cut
and crop them. We gave up trying a plan so futile, and only hit upon
the right way of dealing with them by the merest accident. Walking
along the edge of one of our old grass parks about mid-June some few
years ago, we wished to get hold of a switch or something similar,
wherewith to drive a fractious pony on before us to the park gate.
There was no switch just then at hand, and, without thinking of it, we
bent down, and with both hands pulled steadily and straight upwards at
one of the largest of a luxuriant bracken patch that skirted the path
beside us. To our surprise the plant came up easily and from the very
root, or we should rather say with the very root attached, long,
dark-brown, and something cigar-like <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>in shape and size.
That particular plant, a slight examination satisfied us, was fairly or
literally and for ever <i>eradicated</i>, <i>extirpated</i>. When you
get hold of plant and root, you get all; no other plant can grow in its
stead; no plant, at all events, can honestly call <i>it</i> progenitor.
The thing now was clear; we knew what we had to do, and how simple it
was! One afternoon soon afterwards we called all our people into that
field along with us. In all such cases best lead yourself, if you would
have the thing done right. We pulled a bracken or two straight up and
steadily in their presence, and showed them how it was extracted, even
as a practised dentist, &ldquo;deacon of his craft,&rdquo; deals with
an offending tooth&mdash;root and all complete. They then set to work
along with us, and in an hour or so we had the whole field cleared of
ferns&mdash;quite a large cart-load of them&mdash;each plant with its
black root attached, all of which were afterwards found useful as
bedding for the pony, and the largest and least broken for thatch. In
that field no brackens have since shown themselves. So, if you are
troubled with ferns, the proper way is not to cut them down, for they
will grow again, but to deal with them as we did, and they will trouble
you no more. There is some trouble about it, no doubt, though far less
than you would suppose, and then, you see, we really know nothing at
this moment worth the having to be had <i>without</i> trouble; so take
the trouble and the good together, and be wise.</p>
<p>In your sea-shore wanderings, good reader, you must many a time and
oft have witnessed the graceful flight of the tern or sea-swallow, the
handsomest bird, perhaps, that ever saw its own image reflected in the
glassy surface of a waveless sea; and you must have noticed its sudden
dart and dip, now and again, after its prey into the bosom of the
green, unbroken waves. This, of course, you have seen and admired a
thousand times. But have you ever seen the merlin or merlin falcon
(<i lang="la">Falco &aelig;salon</i>), perform the same feat? No! Well,
we did a few evenings ago; albeit the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>momentary immersion
in the briny blue was probably, nay certainly, what the merlin would
have avoided if it could. It happened in this wise: We were engaged on
the beach painting our boat&mdash;there are few things but we can put
our hand to with more or less success, always barring <i>shooting</i>,
of our deficiency in which we recently made full and honest
confession&mdash;when we suddenly heard that curious and indescribable
half-scream, half-cheep, so well-known to the ornithologist, and which
tells him so plainly that the utterer is a bird&mdash;usually a small
bird&mdash;in dire distress, in constant fear and danger of its life.
Looking round, we saw a merlin in hot chase of a sandpiper (<i lang=
"la">Tringa hypoleucus</i>), pursuer and pursued circling and wheeling
in their arrow-like flight over the bent some hundred yards from the
margin of the sea. Were it not for the manifest distress of the poor
sandpiper, evidenced by its frequent scream, as if invoking all the
kindly powers of heaven and earth to its aid, we should have considered
it a most beautiful and interesting sight. The merlin was evidently
hungry and in earnest, and we made no doubt at all, for there was no
possible way that we could aid it, that the sandpiper was distined to
be the fiery little falcon&rsquo;s evening meal. But <i lang="la">Diis
aliter visum</i>&mdash;the gods had otherwise ordered it. All of a
sudden it seemed to occur to the <i lang="la">Tringa</i> that if there
was the slightest chance of escape for it, it must be in closer
relationship with its favourite and familiar element, the sea; and to
the sea accordingly in one rapid dart the poor bird betook itself. The
merlin, as if aware that there was now at least a possibility that its
prey might after all escape its clutches, made a magnificent dash
after, and just as the sandpiper was over the sea, reached it, and
pounced to strike, but missed; by the smallest fraction of a single
second, a sharp zig-zag in the <i lang="la">Tringa&rsquo;s</i> flight
kept it clear of the stroke, and the merlin, by the force and impetus
of its flight, plunged head over ears into the sea, whence, with
draggled plumage and brine-blinded eyes, it arose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>with
difficulty, and betook itself to a rock ledge at hand to preen and dry
itself, with no other consolation in its disappointment, probably, than
a <i lang="it">sotto voce</i> merlin-wise muttering of the adage,
&ldquo;Better luck next time.&rdquo; The sandpiper, it is needless to
say, was soon a mile away, winging its terrified flight to the opposite
Appin shore. We were glad that the sandpiper had escaped, that the
merlin was disappointed. It is always pleasant to see an evil-doer
baulked in the accomplishment of his evil intentions. And yet we
don&rsquo;t know either. We have called the merlin an evil-doer: are we
entitled so to call him? Was he not as much entitled, could he have
secured it, to have that <i lang="la">Tringa</i> for <i>his</i> evening
meal, as we the delicious red rock cod that in an hour or two
afterwards we enjoyed so heartily to our own supper? Let the reader
think it over, and answer the question to himself at his leisure.

<p class="first"><i lang="la">Audi alteram partem</i> is a sensible
maxim, so reasonable in itself, and mild and deprecatory of tone, that
it rarely fails to commend itself to our sense of right and candour;
for if we would arrive at a right conclusion on any matter in dispute,
we must learn to listen without prejudice to both sides of a question.
We can only hold our own convictions wisely and well, by knowing all
that can be said in antagonism and <i lang="la">per contra</i>. The
following letter from a correspondent in London, who writes under the
pseudonym of &ldquo;Observer,&rdquo; tells rather in favour of those
who entertain grave suspicions as to the morality and harmlessness of
our prickly friend the hedgehog, and, of course, against Mr. Frank
Buckland and ourselves. We are honest enough, however, to give
&ldquo;Observer&rsquo;s&rdquo; communication in full, meanwhile merely
remarking that, obliged as we are to our correspondent for his
attention, and really interesting note, we are by no means convinced
that the hedgehog is either oviphagous or a bird-killer and bird-eater.
At this date [February 1876], and with all our knowledge of the animal,
we fear that nothing less than the catching of him in the very act
would convince us, any number of uncompromising and hard-hearted
gamekeepers, with &ldquo;Observer&rdquo; to back them, to the contrary
notwithstanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While perusing your interesting article on the hedgehog, some
slight personal experiences of this animal recurred to my mind, and I
therefore thought it might be as well to communicate them to you, to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>show that, according to my limited experience,
the hedgehog is not quite such a harmless and innocent creature as you
endeavour to make him, and further, that your practical experiments
with the hungry animals and the eggs are not sufficiently satisfactory
to establish and set at rest once and for ever the hedgehog&rsquo;s
innocency. To be brief: two or three summers ago, while living in the
Highlands of Scotland, and within one hundred and fifty miles of the
Highland capital, about ten o&rsquo;clock on a beautiful Sunday evening
in the month of June, and shortly after a most genial shower of rain
had fallen to refreshen the young crops, my attention was attracted by
the most alarming and violent cackling of a hen that had just begun to
incubate on two or three addled eggs, or &lsquo;nest eggs&rsquo; as
they are called. Wondering what would be the cause of this noisy
demonstration on the part of the hen, and thinking that probably a
thief might be at hand, I at once repaired to where the hen was. I
could see no one about, but there the hen was, as noisy as ever,
looking towards her nest, advancing apparently to charge some unseen
enemy, and then suddenly making a retrograde movement in the most
frantic manner, without attacking her enemy. On stooping down and
peeping into the corner where the nest was (for by this time it was
almost dark), I observed a round dark object in comfortable possession
of the nest; this was a hedgehog. If I remember well, one of the eggs
was broken, and there was very little of the contents left. This, I am
almost sure, was the case, though I would hardly go so far as to swear
to it at this distance of time. Probably in these circumstances you
will say, &lsquo;Then, if you can&rsquo;t actually swear to it, your
information deserves no attention.&rsquo; However, bear with me a
little longer. On another occasion, on a similar fine evening, about
the same hour, and about four weeks after the above, I heard another
hen, which, with a brood of some eight or ten fine young chickens, had
taken up its night quarters quite near the scene of the first row,
making a like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>noise. Thinking a cat might be about, and
therefore must be the enemy now, I went up to see what was doing. There
the hen was, standing a short distance from the nest, with only two
chickens by her side; the others could not be seen. On going nearer the
nest, there was another hedgehog in quiet possession. Below him in the
nest were one or two dead chickens; their little heads were crushed
quite flat and wet, as if some animal had been trying to chew the
heads. Outside the nest were two more dead chickens, their heads being
in the same flat and wet condition. The chickens were about a week old,
and, so far as I can recollect, there was no other disfigurement. In
the morning two more live chickens turned up, and the poor hen had to
be content with a reduced brood of four or five instead of eight or
ten. The hedgehog had been sentenced to a violent death, but,
fortunately for himself, made his escape while search was being made
for any of the surviving chickens. During the next summer a duck had
laid a number of eggs&mdash;more than a dozen&mdash;in a quiet secluded
spot at the root of a birch tree, and which were not discovered by
human eye until they were rather far on in a state of incubation to be
fit for use; so the duck was allowed to keep her eggs in order to hatch
them. One night, about 11 or 11.30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, some
of the inmates of the house were disturbed by the duck coming to one of
the doors, making a great noise, and would not leave. So, to save
further annoyance, the servant rose and locked up poor duck with the
other ducks. In the morning the prisoner was released, and allowed to
go to resume possession of the nest, which, on examination, was found
undisturbed, except that two or three of the eggs were amissing; but
this was thought nothing of, and allowed to pass unnoticed. However, a
few nights after this occurrence, the duck repeated her visit to the
house, was in a greatly disturbed state, and would on no account
whatever be pacified; so, as the night was dark, a light was procured,
and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>writer, along with a friend, went to the nest,
and found a hedgehog sitting on the eggs. Some of them were broken, and
the nest in a great mess. Outside there was an empty shell, and a large
round hole in it. On this occasion the hedgehog had to pay the extreme
penalty. Mentioning these things to the people about, the writer was
informed that it was understood generally that hedgehogs destroyed
eggs, but it had never been known to them that they attacked young
chickens. However, they had never given the matter any attention.
Perhaps these facts I have related may be of some use to you in making
further inquiries about the hedgehog. At any rate, you may rely on the
truth of my statements, as they are no hearsay stories, but facts that
took place before my own eyes. <i>Query</i>&mdash;Granted that the
hedgehog does not eat eggs, then what was he doing in possession of
these three different nests? How were the eggs broken? What animal
killed the chickens, if it was not the hedgehog? Perhaps a weasel would
have done it, but in that case, would the weasel not have inflicted
some serious wound about the throat, and which would have left some
bloody marks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of some half-dozen bird-catchers, or bird-fanciers, as they prefer
calling themselves, that visit the West Highlands professionally from
time to time, our favourite is Mackenzie, a north countryman, we
believe, as one indeed might readily guess from his surname, and well
enough known, we daresay, in and about Inverness, where during our last
visit we noticed with pleasure&mdash;for it is a good sign of a
people&mdash;that birds in cages were exceedingly common. &ldquo;Old
Cowie,&rdquo; another of the fraternity, is a respectable man, with
more knowledge, perhaps, of things in general than any of his brethren
that have chanced to come our way; but for a knowledge of our native
wild-birds, their favourite haunts, food, song, and individual
habits&mdash;idiosyncrasies&mdash;for a knowledge, we say, precise and
accurate to the most astonishing degree on all those matters, you may
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>trust Mackenzie, for he is far and away at the
head of his class, positively unrivalled by any one else that we ever
met with. Of the ornithology of books, of ornithology as a science,
with its systems, classifications, genera, and species, he knows
nothing, of course, but he knows every bird you can refer to under some
favourite provincial cognomen, and he knows it so thoroughly that no
one could possibly know it better. It is true that he knows little or
nothing <i>but</i> birds, but he knows <i>them</i> so well (the birds
of Scotland), so intimately, from constant intercourse with them in
their native haunts and homes, that a &ldquo;crack&rdquo; with him
about them, when once you get him fairly started, is no ordinary treat
to any one so interested in all that concerns our wild-birds as we are,
and have been for well-nigh a quarter of a century. Remembering that
bird-catching is a sort of profession or trade, by which a livelihood,
however precarious, is encompassed, an affair of demand and supply,
with the usual prosaic result of pounds, shillings, and pence&mdash;or
rather of shillings and pence without the pounds, these last seldom
tickling the palms or troubling the purses of the order&mdash;one would
expect to find the bird-catcher a dull, mechanical rogue, a mere
bird-trapper and bird-seller in the dearest market, with no more of
poetry or sentiment about him than about a white-aproned poulterer.
This, however, is far from being the case, at least not always nor even
frequently, for Mackenzie, &ldquo;Old Cowie,&rdquo; and others that we
could name, really and truly love birds for their own sakes, without a
thought frequently of their market value, and you can gather as you
converse with them from their frequent references to the delights as
well as the <i lang="fr">d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ments</i> of their
profession, that they are by no means either unconscious of or
indifferent to the poetry of birds and bird life in their native
haunts, whether on moor or mountain side, by solitary tarn or stream,
in copse and wildwood, amid the wildernesses of inland mountains or by
the margin of the sea. We never knew any one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>so
correctly and minutely conversant with the language of birds as
Mackenzie is. By the language of birds, we do not mean their song, for
song is no more the ordinary speech of birds, though most people think
it is, than it is the ordinary speech of men. Mackenzie, it is true,
can imitate the songs of our different species of warblers with great
taste and exactness, but when we say that he is conversant with the
language of birds, we mean not their song, but their little notes,
abrupt chirpings, and faint whisperings, indicative to the initiated of
the particular thought or <i>motif</i> at the moment predominant in the
feathered breast, whether love or terror, or mere apprehension of
danger, or envy, or rivalry, or combativeness, or notes of warning, or
call of invitation to its kind&mdash;all these, and for every separate
species, Mackenzie imitates with such consummate skill, exactness, and
dexterity, that he not only deceives an ordinary listener when off his
guard&mdash;he has more than once deceived <i>us</i>, though familiar
with birds and bird-notes all our life&mdash;but he deceives the very
birds themselves, as we have often witnessed with no little admiration
and delight. That much of this imitatory work is done
ventriloquistically renders it all the more effective, as well as more
difficult of attainment by others of the fraternity ambitious of
catching and cultivating on their own behalf so desirable a gift. This
knowledge of bird language is, of course, of great value to him as a
bird-catcher, and accounts for his success at seasons seemingly the
most inopportune, and in localities the most unlikely, that an ordinary
bird-catcher would probably search in vain for a single specimen of
goldfinch or aberdevine, linnet or redpole, or anything else in the
shape of a valuable song-bird. In passing and repassing our place, this
wonderful bird-man, as our servant girl styles him, always calls with
such bird news and rare specimens as he thinks most likely to interest
us. The other day he came in a state of great excitement to inform us
that just as he had got several siskins on his limed twigs, a
bird&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>not a hawk of any kind, he was
certain&mdash;dashed out of a copse at hand, pounced upon one of the
siskins, and bore it off and away before his very eyes, ere he could do
anything&mdash;so sudden and unexpected was the attack&mdash;to prevent
it! Momentary as was his glimpse of it, however, Mackenzie&rsquo;s
quick and practised eye enabled him to take in the marauder&rsquo;s
predominant colouring, its shape and size, and mode of flight; and on
describing these to us, we at once exclaimed, a
<i>butcher-bird</i>&mdash;a <i>shrike</i>! The description could apply
to no other British bird-killer that we could think of; and that we
were right we have no more doubt than if we had the culprit already in
our cabinet. Mackenzie was in a rage. &ldquo;You are right, sir; it
must have been a butcher-bird, for now I recollect having once seen a
specimen in Ayrshire. I&rsquo;m bound, however, to lay salt on yon
chap&rsquo;s tail before I am done with him; and you, sir, shall have
him, dead or living. I swear it by all my illustrious ancestors, the
Mackenzies of Kintail!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a melodramatic air
that was very amusing; and shouldering his cages and other
paraphernalia of his craft, he departed with a touch of his cap and a
bow that showed that amongst birds he had learned good manners and
politeness to an extent that as a navvy or hired labourer he would
probably be all his lifetime very much a stranger. He has not returned
to us as yet, so we suppose he is still in pursuit, detective-wise, of
the shrike; and it had better look out, for Mackenzie is just the man
to succeed sooner or later in laying salt upon its tail, as threatened.
The butcher-bird, or shrike, is the <i lang="la">Lanius excubitor</i>
of Linn&aelig;us, an exceeding rare bird in the West Highlands&mdash;in
Scotland, indeed&mdash;so rare that we never saw a living bird of the
order, only stuffed or otherwise preserved cabinet specimens. It preys
on small birds, mice, insects, &amp;c., which it does not tear up from
under its feet like the hawk tribe, but fixes it on a thorn-prickle, or
in the fork of a small branch, and then tears it to pieces with its
bill, which is very strong, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312"
href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>toothed and hooked at the
point. When Mackenzie catches the offender he is now in search of, we
shall have something more to say about the butcher-bird, if
butcher-bird it proves to be.</p>
<p>We have noticed, by the way, that all bird-catchers&mdash;all at
least with whom we have had any acquaintance&mdash;are prodigious
tea-drinkers, not sipping the grateful beverage from cups, observe, but
literally drinking it in bowls&rsquo;-full. They have assured us that
they find it the best thing they can take, not merely as a refresher,
but as a long sustaining element in their dietary throughout their many
wanderings by flood and field. And like all large tea-drinkers,
bird-catchers are a very sober class of men; that they should be so is
indeed a necessity of their craft, for a knock-kneed, shaky-handed,
blear-eyed, nerveless bird-catcher would be as unfit for the successful
prosecution of the labours incident to his profession, as would a
similar physical wreck be for the successful manipulation of his tools
in the more minute and delicate departments of mathematical instrument
making. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=

&ldquo;Dead-Bell&rdquo;&mdash;Sir Walter
Scott&mdash;Hogg&mdash;Mickle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We live in an age of intense literary and intellectual
activity; the tendency of the highest culture of our time [March 1876],
however, it is complained, being towards materialism and scepticism,
the latter either in the form of indifferentism or absolute negation.
The great mass of our people, however&mdash;the uneducated or only
partially educated&mdash;stand at the other extreme; for whilst it is
complained that those of the highest culture believe too little, or
don&rsquo;t believe at all, the common people, it is averred, believe
too much. And it is perfectly true that the latter are indeed
superstitious to an extent of which the mere outsider can have no
adequate conception; and yet, philosophically pondered, there can be no
difficulty, we think, in arriving at the conclusion that of the two
evils over-belief is better than its opposite; that it is better, upon
the whole, to believe too much than too little. A man with any form of
creed, even if it be false, may be led in time to believe aright,
whereas the case of the utterly creedless man is well-nigh hopeless.
For our own part, therefore, we do not look upon the superstitions of
our people with such horror and alarm as many well-meaning persons,
clerical or lay, feel or feign when brought in contact with an evil
which, let the philosophers say what they will, has its good as well as
its bad side. We greatly doubt if, under present circumstances, and in
their present stage of civilisation, the inhabitants of Scotland
generally, and of the Highlands, with which we are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>best
acquainted, in particular, would be at all so religious and devout a
people as they are confessedly allowed to be, were it not for the
substratum of superstition that underlies their better founded beliefs
and religious aspirations. Constantly <i lang="fr">en rapport</i> with
the supernatural and the unseen, they are more disposed than they might
otherwise be to believe in and shape the conduct of their daily lives
in accordance with the doctrine of a future world, with its rewards and
punishments, feeling and acknowledging in a very remarkable manner,
even through the medium of their superstitions&mdash;if erroneous, yet
not always degrading&mdash;the full force and meaning of what the
apostle speaks of in a general way as &ldquo;the powers of the world to
come.&rdquo; An interesting paper might be written in support of the
theory here indicated, a theory that to some may seem a paradox, but
meanwhile it must lie over for some more fitting occasion. Such a task
requires time; for of all the delicate tasks that the philosophic mind
can concern itself with, the most delicate is the endeavour to discover
and recognise the spirit of good things in things evil, and of reason
in things unreasonable. Meanwhile, it is the truth, account for it as
we may, that notwithstanding the multiplication of ministers and
churches, schoolmasters and school boards, &ldquo;Increase of
Episcopate&rdquo; Bill, and all the rest of it, there is still a lively
undercurrent of superstition amongst our people, do what you can to
stamp it out or otherwise; and that those who believe in it most
implicitly are by no means the worst people either. An example of a
very common superstition is the following:&mdash;A few evenings ago, at
an accidental gathering of some half-dozen families in a house in our
neighbourhood, the subjoined conversation took place with regard to a
recent death in the parish. Mrs. B.&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose you have all
heard of the death of X. L., poor fellow. It was reported he was better
yesterday, but I knew last night that I should hear of a death some
time to-day, and knowing of no one else at present <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>unwell, I decided that it must be X. L.&rsquo;s
death that was foretold me.&rdquo; Mrs. C.&mdash;&ldquo;Foretold you!
how?&rdquo; Mrs. B.&mdash;&ldquo;Why, thus: long after dark last night,
as I was busy getting the children&rsquo;s supper, the cock, that had
gone to roost as usual, suddenly stood up on his perch, and crowed a
long and loud crow that startled us all; and I made Katie say the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, for I knew that a cock crowing at an hour so
untimeous meant a death in our neighbourhood, and nothing else. On
inquiry, I find that X. L. died just about that time.&rdquo; Mrs.
D.&mdash;&ldquo;I knew it too, that there was to be a death in our
neighbourhood. My nose itched so much all last evening, and the itching
was on the left nostril side, and I was certain that it was to be the
death of a male that I should hear of. I had not, however, heard that
X. L. was so very poorly.&rdquo; Mrs. F.&mdash;&ldquo;While at
breakfast this morning, I could hardly eat anything, so loud and
persistent was the ringing in my ears. It was just like the tolling of
the church bell.&rdquo; Now, the reader must remember that these were
highly respectable women, of some education, and in every way of good
repute; and yet they had no idea at all that there was anything silly
or wrong about their superstition, of which they made no secret, and
which was reported to us immediately afterwards by one who was present.
Now, we ask, if one was present and heard it all, how could he best
deal with the believer in this superstition, a superstition so
wide-spread that it may be said to be universal. Any attempt at getting
angry and driving it out of them by the mere force and weight of your
superior enlightenment would be a false move, sure to be attended by no
good results. Laughing at the whole affair might perhaps be a more
successful way of dealing with the nonsense, but in neither way would
you be likely to make them look at the matter from your particular
light and point of view. Admitting that it was rank superstition and
sheer nonsense, there was this one good thing attending it; it led to
much moralising on the shortness and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>uncertainty of human
life, and the unabidingness generally of all sublunary things; and the
superstition was perhaps more effectual in this direction than would be
the most carefully composed sermon. But the philosophic aspect of the
case apart, let us inquire why the facts mentioned should be held as
premonitory of death. The crowing of the cock has probably some
connection with the denial of St. Peter, and in it, too, may perhaps be
traced a faint remnant of the bird divination of the ancients. As to
the itching of the nose, we confess our inability to say anything
satisfactory, beyond the fact that in old times anything unusual and
difficult to be reasonably accounted for in man&rsquo;s physical
economy, as well as in his mental, was at once attributed to a
supernatural cause. Of this the ringing in the ears, as well as the
itching in the nose, must be held to be an example. The well-known
ringing in the ears does come with extraordinary suddenness, as we have
all experienced, and when it comes makes the most staid philosopher
look foolish and out of sorts for the moment. Its connection with death
is perhaps to be traced to the passing bell of early and medi&aelig;val
times, and to the tolling of bells at funerals even in our own day. Sir
Walter Scott, who knew the peasantry of Scotland so well, and
sympathised so much even with their superstitions, has a happy
reference to the death-bell in a passage in <i>Marmion</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;For soon Lord Marmion raised his head,</p>
<p class="line">And, smiling, to Fitz-Eustace said&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;Is it not strange, that, as ye sung,</p>
<p class="line">Seem&rsquo;d in mine ear a death-peal rung,</p>
<p class="line">Such as in nunneries they toll</p>
<p class="line">For some departing sister&rsquo;s soul?</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Say, what may this portend?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">Then first the Palmer silence broke</p>
<p class="line">(The livelong day he had not spoke),</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">&lsquo;The death of a dear
friend.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">On this passage there is an interesting note very
<i>apropos</i> to our subject:&mdash;&ldquo;Among other omens to which
faithful credit is given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href=
"#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>among the Scottish peasantry is
what is called the &lsquo;dead-bell,&rsquo; explained by my friend
James Hogg to be that tinkling in the ears which the country people
regard as the secret intelligence of some friend&rsquo;s
decease.&rdquo; He tells a story to the purpose in the &ldquo;Mountain
Bard,&rdquo; p. 26&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O lady, &rsquo;tis dark, an&rsquo; I heard the
dead-bell,</p>
<p class="line">An&rsquo; I darena gae younder for gowd nor
fee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;By the dead-bell,&rdquo; says Hogg, &ldquo;is
meant a tinkling in the ears, which our peasantry in the country regard
as a secret intelligence of some friend&rsquo;s decease. Thus this
natural occurrence strikes many with superstitious awe. This reminds me
of a trifling anecdote which I will relate as an instance. Our two
servant girls agreed to go an errand of their own one night after
supper, to a considerable distance, from which I strove to persuade
them, but could not prevail. So, after going to the apartment in which
I slept, I took a drinking-glass, and coming close to the back of the
door, made two or three sweeps round the lips of the glass with my
fingers, which caused a loud, shrill sound. I then overheard the
following dialogue:&mdash;B.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, mercy! the dead-bell went
through my head just now with such a knell as I never heard.&rdquo;
C.&mdash;&ldquo;I heard it too.&rdquo; B.&mdash;&ldquo;Did you indeed?
That is remarkable. I never knew of two hearing it at the same time
before.&rdquo; C.&mdash;&ldquo;We will not go to Midgehope
to-night.&rdquo; B.&mdash;&ldquo;No! I wouldn&rsquo;t go for all the
world! I warrant it is my poor brother, Wat; who knows what these wild
Irishes may have done to him?&rdquo; Tinkling, however, which both
Scott and Hogg use, is not the word. It is more of a ringing, so clear
and loud at times, that we once heard a little girl say &ldquo;there
was a bell in her head.&rdquo; Our authorities above confess that it is
called the &ldquo;dead-<i>bell</i>&rdquo; amongst the peasantry, and by
bell they mean not a tinkling but a loud and very pronounced sound, as
if of solid metal striking hollow metal, and causing the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>bell-sound with which we are all so familiar.
Mickle, in his fine ballad <i>Cumnor Hall</i>, has a reference to the
same superstition:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The death-bell thrice was heard to ring,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">An aerial voice was heard to call,</p>
<p class="line">And thrice the raven flapp&rsquo;d its wing</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Around the towers of Cumnor Hall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To sneer at such beliefs, and pooh-pooh them
superciliously and from a philosophical stand-point, is easy; it has
been tried with but little satisfactory result. The true philosopher
will be more and more disposed, the more he deals with such matters,
and the closer he examines them, to fall back on Hamlet&rsquo;s dictum,
&ldquo;That there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt
of in our philosophy.&rdquo; So ineradicable is superstition of this
sort, that you may battle with it long enough&mdash;we have battled
with it for years&mdash;and find it at last by no means the weaker of
your assaults, no matter how cautiously and circuitously you select to
deal with it.</p>
<p>After an unusually mild and open season, we have just had a taste of
downright winter in the bitterly cold gales and drifting snow-storms of
the last few days. Our weatherwise old folks are of course delighted
that winter in proper dress and form has come at long last; better late
than never, is the cry, and a bright and warm spring in due course is
confidently predicted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href=

<p class="first">After rather more than six consecutive weeks of
weather so hot and dry and parching [May 1876], that we were all
rapidly becoming hide-bound, brown-skinned, and sapless as so many
Egyptian mummies, the rain came at last; came, too, not deluge-wise,
and with a splash and a roar as is generally the case after such
long-continued droughts, but calmly and softly as falls the dew of
sleep on infant eyelids, and without a breath of accompanying wind. The
earth, long agape with thirst, drank it in greedily, and vegetable and
animal life alike rejoiced in the grateful quiet as well as in the
copiousness of the blessed rainfall. You should have heard how, when
the first drop began to fall, our wild-birds welcomed it. All at once,
in wood, and copse, and hedgerow, they burst out into loud and gladsome
song; nor did they cease when the rainfall was heaviest, as they
usually do, but kept it up far into the night, the merle and
song-thrush now and again breaking out afresh as if they couldn&rsquo;t
sufficiently express their joy, even after we had retired to rest, and
well pleased lay listening to the music of the raindrops as they fell
plashing and pattering from the eaves. Even our least accomplished
songsters took their share in this concert, and if they did not, simply
because they could not, sing as well as their more gifted companions,
they made at least, as the <i>Ancient Mariner</i> has it, a pleasant
&ldquo;jargoning,&rdquo; therein, dear reader, teaching us all this
lesson, that if our gifts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href=
"#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>prevent us from playing any great
or prominent part in the orchestra of life, we are yet all the same to
perform the parts assigned us as best we may, and always cheerily and
with a will. Next morning again was calm and mild and beautiful as a
summer morning could be, while the country already looked so fresh and
green and lovely that one could hardly believe that such a marvellous
change had taken place in the course of a single night; so potent, in
such circumstances, is the kindly touch of the Rain King&rsquo;s-magic
wand.</p>
<p>The plague of mice in Upper Teviotdale is a very serious matter
indeed, and the most energetic steps should at once be taken in order
to check and, if possible, stamp out the evil. These little rodents
multiply with incredible rapidity, and if they are to be fought
<i lang="fr"><span class="corr" id="xd26e7608" title=
"Source: a">&agrave;</span> l&rsquo;outrance</i> and conquered, the
sooner the campaign is opened, and the more vigorously it is conducted,
the easier and speedier will be the victory. The short-tailed
field-mouse is fortunately a rare animal in the Highlands, though we
have occasionally met with it in the districts of Lorne, Lochaber, and
Badenoch. We have also seen it on the lands of Drumfin, near Tobermory,
in the island of Mull. Once seen, it is easily recognised again. Its
colour, instead of being of the ordinary &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; shade of
grey or brown, is red, or reddish; its head is more bullet-like and
rounder, and its snout blunter than in any of its congeners; and its
tail ends abruptly, giving that appendage a <i>docked</i> and stumpy
look, as if by accident or design one-third of its proper length had
been cut off in early life; and hence its common designation of
short-tailed field-mouse. Every one who has tried to capture a common
domestic mouse with the bare hand, knows to his cost how quickly and
sharply it can bite; but the little field-mouse never once attempts to
bite the hand that holds it. If pounced upon while running about in the
rough bent grass in which it usually shelters, it no sooner feels
itself fairly enclosed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href=
"#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>your hand than it seems to become
paralysed through sheer excess of terror, and you may handle it for a
time and turn it about in all directions as if it were a stuffed
specimen, without its once offering to escape or defend itself in any
way. If, however, you let it slip from your hand to the ground, it is
at once off and away, and, search for it as you may, you are never
likely to see it again. For its size the <i lang="la">Arvicola
agrestis</i> is a very powerful little animal, particularly strong in
the neck, shoulder, and fore-arm, a provision whereby it is enabled to
dig and burrow its way underground when necessary, with all the ease
and rapidity almost of the mole itself. It is very fond of water, which
it drinks often and greedily, and hence it is that it is never found at
any great distance from a plentiful supply of its favourite beverage.
One that a lady friend of ours kept for some months in a cage, drank,
more or less, she assures us, during every half-hour of the day, and if
its supply at any time happened to fail by any neglect or oversight of
its mistress, the thirsty little toper squeaked querulously and nibbled
angrily at the bars and wood-work of its cage until its water-dish was
replenished. When it had drank enough, it frequently stepped into the
dish, and frisked about in such a manner as to wet its breast and lower
parts of its body thoroughly, when it would retire to a corner of its
cage in which was a little raised platform, and, sitting up on its
quarters, squirrel-wise, rub and cleanse its head and face with both
paws in a very comical manner. It was fed on succulent grasses and
lettuce leaves and endive from the garden, of which latter it was very
fond. It also ate bread steeped in milk, and apples, both raw and
boiled. It finally met the fate of most cage pets; the cat got at it
and killed it. We have only heard of one instance in which the <i lang=
"la">Arvicola</i> became so numerous in the West Highlands as to become
a pest that was only got rid of with great trouble and no little
expense. This was on the estate of Ardgour, in our own parish.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>About seventy years ago, the late Colonel
Maclean, grandfather of the present proprietor, planted the greater
part of the woods that now make the place so beautiful&mdash;at this
moment one of the loveliest spots in all the Highlands. Shortly after
the young trees were planted, the field-mouse made its appearance, and
in a few months so rapidly increased its numbers, that they were on all
hands declared a nuisance that must be got rid of at any cost. Their
favourite food in this instance seemed to be the tender rootlets and
bark of the smaller trees, thousands of which straightway shrivelled up
and died away owing to the little rodent&rsquo;s unkindly attentions.
Colonel Maclean, who was eminently a man of action, vowed that such a
state of things was beyond all bearing, and must be put a stop to at
all hazards. With a host of willing workers, he straightway set about
what for a time appeared a hopeless task, employing every conceivable
means that wit or ingenuity could devise in order to check, and if
possible stamp out the mouse plague. Having heard of a plan adopted
under similar circumstances in the Dean and New Forests in England,
holes and trenches were dug in all directions, and pitfalls ingeniously
constructed, in which very soon scores of the marauders were caught and
killed every morning. The cats in every house in the hamlet, purposely
kept for the time on short commons at home, were locked out at night
and allowed to cater for themselves; and they fell upon the rodents
tooth and nail, doing such execution that they soon became sleek and
fat as cats were never known in Ardgour before or since. At convenient
spots large fires were kindled, on which cauldrons of water were
boiled, kettles of which, as hot as hot could be, were poured into such
burrows as showed signs of habitation, with a view to scalding the
inmates to death. This was generally done in the early morning, to make
sure of finding the enemy at home, for the field-mouse, like most of
the rodents, is mainly a nocturnal feeder. The keepers had orders for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>the time to cease annoying
vermin&mdash;so-called&mdash;of any kind, the result being that in a
short time stoats, weasels, ravens, grey crows, hawks, and owls
abounded, and these, you may believe, did yeoman service in the
campaign; they were the cavalry that swept off the scattered fugitives.
By such active measures the enemy was exterminated in a single season,
and never again, so far as we know, showed face on Loch-Linnhe-side. It
was Colonel Maclean&rsquo;s opinion that the mice were imported; that
the first pair, or more, perhaps, were brought from the south in the
straw and moss and matting in which the roots of the more valuable and
delicate plants and trees were packed. From the above our Teviotdale
friends may perhaps gather some wrinkles that may be of use to them in
their efforts to relieve themselves from their field-mouse
invasion.</p>
<p>And writing of the field-mouse reminds us that amongst our own
domestic mice there is at present what is generally, if somewhat
erroneously, called a &ldquo;singing mouse.&rdquo; About a fortnight
ago it attracted the attention of a young lady, who heard it at
midnight, and thought at the time it was the twittering of some bird at
her bedroom window. It was afterwards heard by others, and finally by
ourselves, as we sat up late one night writing. That it was not a bird
we were certain, and guessing the truth&mdash;for years ago we had
become acquainted with the notes&mdash;we watched and waited until the
&ldquo;jargoning&rdquo; seemed to proceed from a closed press
immediately behind our chair, which we gently opened, and had a glimpse
of the performer, who vanished, of course, but soon again began its
voluntary, or involuntary rather, behind the wainscoting in another
corner of the room. It was, in short, a &ldquo;singing mouse;&rdquo; an
involuntary music, however, with which the poor mouse would gladly
dispense if it could. Birds, as we know, are sometimes incited to song
by sheer rivalry and rage; sometimes by poignant sorrow for the loss of
a mate, or the despoliation of a nest <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>of its treasure of
eggs or callow young; but as a rule a bird sings from pure joyousness
of heart and exhilaration of spirits. When a mouse &ldquo;sings&rdquo;
it is owing to a laryngeal disease, a sort of fungoid growth in the
throat, which obstructs the breathing, causing the animal to emit the
notes which have been foolishly called &ldquo;singing,&rdquo; and
which, the clearer and more bird-like they become, only in truth
indicate the more advanced stages of a malady which invariably ends in
death. Our attention was first directed to this matter by a
distinguished comparative anatomist, the late Professor John Reid of
St. Andrews, whose curiosity as a naturalist was unbounded, only
equalled by the untiring patience and care and caution with which, step
by step, he wrought out his conclusions. It is difficult to describe
the &ldquo;singing&rdquo; of a mouse thus affected to those who have
not heard it for themselves. It may be said to be in the main a
half-whistle half-wheeze, now and again interrupted by some rapid
clicking notes of a somewhat metallic ring, as if a small bit of stick
was being smartly and rapidly, but very lightly, struck on the very
extremity of the treble string of a guitar or violin. Our
&ldquo;singing mouse,&rdquo; in whom, poor thing, we were all much
interested, has not been heard for a night or two; it has probably gone
the way all mice, as well as men, must go when respiration becomes
impossible.</p>
<p>An amusing paragraph is at present going the round of the papers
about a farmer who, having ordered a hogshead of nitrate of soda for
agricultural purposes, got hold somehow of a hogshead of sugar instead,
which latter, in ignorance of its quality, he sowed broadcast over his
land. Now, at length aware of the mistake, he is said to be waiting and
watching with much curiosity as to how the saccharine crystals turn out
as fertilisers. The story, which may be true enough, reminds us of an
amusing mistake of a somewhat similar nature into which one of the
crofters in our neighbourhood very innocently fell some years ago. He
had attended the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325"
name="pb325">325</a>]</span>Fort-William June market, and amongst other
things brought home with him, on his return in the evening, two small
parcels, one containing one pound of turnip seed, the other the same
quantity red clover seed. Next morning he was up bright and early, and
as an exercise that might perhaps help to drive away a headache, not
uncommon on such occasions, he resolved, the day being favourable, to
sow his turnip and clover seeds. He commenced, and, very unwittingly
you may believe, sowed the turnip seed broadcast among the barley
braird, and the red clover seed in the drills prepared for the turnips!
The blunder was only discovered several days afterwards, when the seeds
began to sprout after their kind, and matters were rectified as the
case best allowed; but poor Donald never heard the last of the joke,
which, when followed beyond certain limits, used to make him
exceedingly angry.</p>
<p>Mackenzie the bird-catcher, <i lang="la">facile princeps</i> the
king and head of his order, called upon us to-day, and made us a
present of the bonniest little redpole we ever set eyes upon. Its
colouring is exquisitely beautiful, differing from the usual plumage of
the species in having several little snow-white spots irregularly
sprinkled over the coverts of either wing, and its neck and breast of a
mingled shade of pink and crimson of exceeding richness, that makes it
far and away the handsomest bird of the order we ever saw. At first we
took it for a foreign bird, or a bird that had been artificially
painted in order to deceive us, and it was only on handling and
thoroughly examining him that we became convinced that the bird was a
genuine, though curiously coloured, specimen of its species, and that
we had it before us just as it was captured some days ago in
Glentarbet, near Strontian. Of all our cage-birds, the redpole
(<i lang="la">Fringalla linaria</i>, Linn.) is perhaps the soonest
reconciled to loss of liberty and prolonged captivity. Our little pet,
whose cage hangs almost within arm&rsquo;s length of us as we write,
seems perfectly happy, and is already singing with all his might, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>goldfinch in another cage beside him busily
scolding him all the time for having the impudence to sing so well, or
sing at all, in interruption of his own louder and clearer notes.
Cage-birds properly treated are a great amusement, and, if you pay them
due attention, evince in a very short time a degree of intelligence so
remarkable that you only wonder, philosophising craniologically, how so
much of it can find lodging-room within their little heads.</p>
<p>Mackenzie is commissioned to go to Norway and Sweden this summer in
search of a lot of crossbills, grossbeaks, and other birds, for a
wealthy gentleman in the south, who is a great bird-fancier. Let him
only once get to their habitat, and Mackenzie is just the man to lay
salt on the tail of any bird that flies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With a bright sun overhead, at noon as nearly vertical
as it can ever be in our latitudes, and a steady, kindly warmth, and no
lack now of genial showers, our West Highlands are now [June 1876]
beautiful exceedingly, almost at the height and heyday of their summer
loveliness, while crops of all kinds are at their present stage all
that we could wish them. Tourists in considerable numbers are already
on the move; and coaches and steamers alike are beginning to carry
daily increasing crowds of passengers, so delighted with the attention
paid them, and the elegance and comfort of their surroundings whether
afloat or ashore, that a crack with them, as you chance to forgather of
an evening, is always pleasant, for the essentials of a pleasant
conversation are there to begin with; they are pleased, and you are
glad that it is so; the rest is all smooth sailing. You meet an
occasional grumbler of course; a wretch, miserable himself, and anxious
to make every one else miserable also. An extraordinary curiosity, in
truth, is your thorough grumbler. The faculty would probably explain it
all away by a reference to dyspepsia or some serious derangement of
liver. From frequent and close study, however, of a not uninteresting
phenomenon, we are rather inclined to think otherwise. In the genuine
grumbler the disposition to look at things obliquely, and from a false
or foreshortened point of view, seems ingrained in and interwoven with
his very nature. In everything he says and does you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>detect a perverseness of disposition and a
<i>thrawnness</i> of temper that you cannot believe to be temporary or
accidental, but a veritable part and portion of the man&rsquo;s being
from the first. The old dictum about the poet, which after all is only
true in a sense, is true of the grumbler absolutely. <i lang=
"la">Grumblerus nascitur, non fit</i>; he was born a grumbler, and if
you put his mother in the witness box, and she chose to entertain you
with reminiscences of his infancy, her testimony, we venture to say,
would go to show that he kicked and screamed at existence and all the
surroundings of his nursery at the earliest moment possible for such an
exhibition, and that this disposition to hit out right and left
indiscriminately at every one and everything, grew with his growth and
strengthened with his strength, till in fulness of time he became the
thoroughbred grumbler who sat opposite you at the <i lang="fr">table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> a week ago, or rode with you atop of the coach
yesterday. With spur on heel, and once fairly in the stirrups, your
grumbler is ready to tilt, in dearth of anything more substantial, at
his own shadow. Any attempt to mollify him, however well-meant and
carefully worded, only makes him worse. Do what you can, he remains a
grumbler still&mdash;implacable, unappeasable. As we generally meet
with him here, his grievances for the most part are as to the steamer
or coach by which he has travelled, and the food that he has had to
eat. Try to put him right according to your view of it, and you are
sure to catch it hot and heavy for your interference in a matter which
he declares concerns <i>him</i> alone, and yet with which he has been
pestering everybody that would for a moment listen to him all the way
from Oban to Staffa, or from Ballachulish to Tyndrum. Give a man of
this kind the softest cushion in the coziest corner of
Cleopatra&rsquo;s barge; the box seat in the victor&rsquo;s own chariot
in a triumphal procession; a first and full supply of all the
delicacies at the table of Apicius of <i lang="la">De r&ecirc;
Culinaria</i> fame, and he would still be the same fault-finder and
grumbler. One way of shutting up the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>inveterate grumbler,
very effectual in most cases, is to fool him to the top of his
bent&mdash;to give him line, in the piscatorial sense. If he complains
that his seat on the coach is hard and the rails behind hurt his spine,
assure him at once, in a confidential sort of way, that you believe the
axle is horribly twisted, and is as likely as not to snap in twain just
about half-way down the next incline. If he complains of the dust, give
it as your candid opinion that the Road Trustees should be heavily
fined for not allaying the nuisance by a properly arranged water-cart
service all over the Black Mount. If he complains that the steamer
trembles in all her timbers, and the steam, as it escapes at the
calling-places, makes a horrible noise, agree with him at once, hinting
that an explosion of the boiler is by no means an unlikely event
through the carelessness of the coal-begrimed stoker, who is just then
cooling himself at an open air-hole, and wiping his brow with a wisp of
tow. If at dinner he abuses the soup, ask him how it could possibly be
good, seeing that the water whereof it is made was taken a week ago, by
means of a tarry bucket, from the third lock of the Crinan Canal? Does
he abuse his salmon? Shake your head sadly, and point with your fork
towards the round of beef, hinting that at this season cattle sometimes
die a natural death, and then their carcasses are to be had for a third
of the market price of good beef. Go with him and beyond him in this
sort of way for a little, and he will soon see that you are only poking
your fun at him, and the chances are that he will cease troubling
<i>you</i> at all events with his complaints for the rest of the day.
After all, however, it is but justice to observe that even your
inveterate grumbler is not infrequently a much more amiable person than
he seems; kind, too, after a fashion, and amazingly liberal when a
proper occasion offers.</p>
<p>Fish are now becoming plentiful along our shores, and with a little
trouble in selecting a very early or a very late hour, and watching the
state of the tides, they may be caught in considerable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>numbers with rod and line; and irrespective of
their value as an article of food, the pastime is by no means
contemptible even as a matter of sport, though, sooth to say, many
people live within sight of the sea for years, and know little or
nothing of the amusement that may be had so readily and cheaply in this
way. Those caught at present are principally whitings, lythes, and
seths, or coal-fish, with an occasional sea-bream. This last is
reckoned a somewhat coarse fish, but it is by no means bad eating when
properly cooked and served, and you recollect as you eat that the price
of mutton is something like a shilling the pound, and frequently not to
be had even at that.</p>
<p>More prone, perhaps, to superstition in every form than their more
inland brethren, our maritime population have quite a number of
<i>freits</i>, forms, fancies, and superstitious observances, most of
them only silly and harmless enough, in connection with all their
sea-fishing adventures, whether with rod, net, or line. A few evenings
ago, as a party of four, douce and decent men enough, were preparing to
launch their boat to go a-fishing, we chanced to pass along the beach,
joining them, as has long been our habit in such circumstances, for a
few minutes&rsquo; conversation. Suddenly, as we were speaking, a large
black-backed gull (<i lang="la">Larus marinus</i>) wheeled towards us
out of a flock that were lazily circling about at a considerable
distance seawards. Right towards us, as if on some express and special
errand, came the gull, one of the largest and most beautiful of
sea-birds, until he was within less than fifty yards of us, when by a
change of poise, and a scarcely perceptible movement of wing, he slowly
swept round our heads, screaming the while as only a black-backed gull
can scream&mdash;a wild and eerie note that may be heard for a league.
The gull&rsquo;s business, whatever it might be, was so manifestly
connected with one or all of us, or with the boat, perhaps, round which
we were standing on the beach, that it could not but attract
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>attention and provoke comment from the most
unobservant. After circling some half-dozen times round and round and
right above our heads, the bird, with one loud parting scream&mdash;and
yet scream is not the word either; the Gaelic <i>guileag</i> is nearer
it&mdash;and with an upward oblique sweep, so beautifully easy and
effortless that it seemed the result of a simple act of volition rather
than a grand <i>pas</i> in volitation, flew away to join his
companions, who were now heard clamouring over a coal-fish <i>goil</i>
or boil, as the Highlanders call the ebullition of the surface play of
a shoal of sea-fish. The men looked at each other and at us meaningly;
and at last out it came. &ldquo;Small chance,&rdquo; said one of them,
&ldquo;have we of anything like a good fishing this evening: better for
us to stay at home.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; we quietly inquired.
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; was the response, &ldquo;I never knew a gull
act in that sort of way but it meant bad luck in fishing, and the
non-accomplishment of one&rsquo;s errand afloat, whatever it might
be.&rdquo; The rest agreed with the speaker, but we persuaded them,
after some trouble, to proceed to their fishing-ground, to give it a
trial at least; and when, at a much later hour, they returned, we were
on the beach to meet them, and found that after all they had made an
excellent fishing. There and then we sat down beside them as they were
dividing their fish into equal shares, and told them the following
story from Josephus, <i>Against Apion</i>. Quoting from Hecat&aelig;us,
the great Jewish historian proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;As I was myself going
to the Red Sea, there followed us a man, whose name was Mosollam; he
was one of the Jewish horsemen who conducted us. He was a person of
great courage, of a strong body, and by all allowed to be the most
skilful archer that was either among the Greeks or barbarians. Now,
this man, as people were in great numbers passing along the road, and a
certain augur was observing an augury by a bird, and requiring them all
to stand still, inquired what they staid for. Hereupon the augur showed
him the bird from whence he told his augury, and told him that if
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>the bird staid where he was, they ought all to
stand still; but that if he got up and flew onward, they must go
forward; but that if he flew backward, they must retire again. Mosollam
made no reply, but drew his bow and shot at the bird, and hit him and
killed him; and as the augur and some others were very angry, and
wished imprecations upon him, he answered them thus:&mdash;&lsquo;Why
are you so mad as to take this most unhappy bird into your hands? for
how can this bird give us any true information concerning our march,
which could not foresee how to save himself? For had he been able to
foreknow what was future, he would not have come to this place, but
would have been afraid lest Mosollam the Jew would shoot him as he has
done, and kill him.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The men, who had listened most
attentively, smiled as we concluded, and agreed that Mosollam must have
been a very sensible man; and vowed that for the future they would
attach no more meaning or importance to a circling, screaming gull,
than to the chirping of a wren in the elder bushes at the cottage
doors. And what after all, the reader may ask, brought the black-backed
gull circling and screaming over your heads? Well, from its great and
immense spread of wing, it was probably the leader and guardian of its
own particular flock, and as such thought it his duty to reconnoitre in
person, in case the five men about the boat on the beach should have
sinister intentions as to him or his. His scream or <i lang=
"gd">guileag</i> was just his way of telegraphing the results of his
observations to his distant companions; or he may have been scolding us
in his own manner for our manifest intention of leaving the land, and
invading what he considered his own proper element and territory, the
sea. A more prosaic explanation, if it please you better, is perhaps to
be found in the fact that the boat was internally largely incrusted
with fish scales, and smelt strongly of fish, and that that, to one of
his sensitive olfactory nerves, was the only or main attraction, the
rest being mere idle curiosity, from which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>birds are no more exempt than men. One thing
only is certain, if difficult to be accounted for, and that is, that
individual gulls frequently act as this gull acted when a boat is about
to put off from the shore in the fishing season, which being
occasionally connected, as must sometimes happen, however accidentally,
with an unsuccessful fishing adventure, gave rise to the silly
superstition which, by the aid of Flavius Josephus, we were able in
this instance at least successfully to combat. <span class=

Jelly-Fish&mdash;The amount of solid matter in Jelly-Fish.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The unprecedented heat of mid-August lasted with us
here precisely a fortnight [September 1876]. Beginning on the 10th, it
continued with little intermission or mitigation till the 24th, when
the wind suddenly chopped round to the south-west, our rainy quarter;
the sky assumed the threatening aspect, an ugly interminglement of
black and dark grey, with which we are only too familiar, and rain
began to fall with that <i>dour</i>, persistent pattering, and aimless
horizontal drift, which sufficed to convince the most careless and
unobservant student of our West Highlands meteorology that it was
neither a thunder-plump nor a mere passing shower, but a determined and
regular &ldquo;set-in&rdquo; of probably some days, or, it might be, of
some weeks&rsquo; duration. The last ten days have accordingly been
more or less wet, and as the corn over the country generally is about
ripe for scythe and sickle, many an anxious eye is cast heavenwards
with wistfullest glance, morning, noon, and night, in hopes of a change
of wind and a return to fair weather. We are about tired of advocating
the advantages of early sowing to our friends of the West Highlands. We
are content with once again stating the fact that, having sown early,
our own corn was cut in ripe and good condition on the 17th August, and
safely housed without having once been touched by a single drop of
rain. A single armful of such well-preserved provender is worth a whole
back-burden of the washed-out and sapless stuff <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>that
usually goes by the name of &ldquo;wintering&rdquo; and &ldquo;winter
keep&rdquo; in this and the neighbouring districts. It is proper to
say, however, that, though so difficult to move to an earlier date in
corn-sowing, our people here have of recent years been more amenable to
good advice in the matter of potato culture. This year a large breadth
of potatoes was planted in March and early April, and the consequence
is that these are now nearly ripe, and of the best quality, stronger
too, and in every way better able to resist the attacks of
blight&mdash;<i lang="la">absit omen!</i>&mdash;should it unfortunately
come their way, as we hope it won&rsquo;t; while the still green and
half-ripe tubers of later plantings would probably suffer largely under
a similar visitation. Not even when it is quite ready for the sickle do
people generally cut their corn timeously. Too often it is allowed to
ripen overmuch, till the straw is over-dry and sapless, besides the
inevitable loss of grain in the stooking and subsequent ingathering. It
is very much the same with hay. As a rule, it is left too long uncut,
by which its quality is sadly deteriorated. Nor is this mistake in
haymaking peculiar to the west coast, but much too common over all the
country. Even in Morayshire and about Inverness the hay crop is, as a
rule, allowed to ripen over-much. If it were cut ten days or a
fortnight earlier it would weigh more, smell sweeter, be more
nutritious, and better every way than under the present system, which
allows it not merely to ripen, but to more than ripen, to wither up and
lose most of its sap and seed before it is cut and secured. It may,
perhaps, be laid down as an axiom that root crops cannot be allowed to
ripen over-much; cereals and grasses most certainly may.</p>
<p>Cavill&rsquo;s recent attempt to swim the Channel, in rivalry of
Captain Webb&rsquo;s feat, was a failure, and had medical aid not been
so opportunely at hand when the swimmer, comatose and unconscious, was
lifted out of the water by his friends in the attendant lugger, the
venture, noteworthy, though unsuccessful, for its pluck and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>daring, would probably have resulted in
something far more serious than mere failure. In accounting for his
non-success, and his state of extreme exhaustion when taken out of the
water, Cavill largely blames the jelly-fish or sea-blubber, through
perfect shoals of which he had once and again to force his way; and
although he wore a thin jersey, which must have been some protection,
enough of the bare skin was exposed to contact with the cold, clammy,
slimy <i>Medus&aelig;</i>, to make him exceedingly nervous and
generally uncomfortable throughout a full third of the distance
covered. The number of these Medus&aelig; to be met with at certain
seasons all along the British shores is enormous; and towards the close
of summer and early autumn they are more abundant, perhaps, in our
western lochs than anywhere else. Looking over the boat&rsquo;s side on
a fine day, we have seen them in our own Loch Leven in incalculable
numbers, thick as autumnal leaves in Vallambrosa, or the stars in the
Milky Way&mdash;of all shapes and sizes too, swimming about aimlessly
by a slow but constant contraction and expansion, regular as the beat
of a pendulum, of their umbrella-like bodies, fringed like a
lady&rsquo;s parasol, with a close edging of thread-like <i>cilia</i>,
and frequently having long, pendulous tentacul&aelig; attached to their
under surface, giving the healthy animal, when busy in its proper
element, a very curious appearance. Though the jelly-fish is in
constant motion&mdash;in perpetual motion, so to speak, for it never
rests, that ever we could discover, either by night or day&mdash;its
progress in the sea is rather due to the set of the wind and the
tide-drift than its own exertions, its incessant labours of contraction
and expansion being performed not so much for the purpose of shifting
its place in the water, as for the purpose of grasping and sucking in
at each contraction such microscopic organisms as form its food. It is
true that in a calm and tideless sea its motions cause it to be carried
in the direction of the contracting beat an inch or thereby at a time,
but this progress is clearly accidental and unintentional, so far as it
is concerned, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>the great object of the incessant contraction
and expansion being, as we have said, not so much change of place as
the capture and insuction of its ordinary food. The Medus&aelig; swim
at all depths in the sea, but as a rule they seem to prefer feeding
within a fathom or two of the surface, particularly if the sun is
bright and the sea is perfectly calm. The mouth of the Medusa is in the
centre of the under concave surface, and the animal&rsquo;s <i lang=
"la">modus operandi</i> in sweeping in its food towards this orifice is
not difficult to understand. Stretch out your right hand, with its back
or knuckle surface uppermost. First expand the hand and fingers to
their full extent, then contract so as almost, but not quite, to close
the hand, not quickly, but very firmly and decidedly. Continue in this
way opening out and closing the hand and fingers, not quite so fast as
a second&rsquo;s beating pendulum oscillates, and you have the perfect
analogue, or more properly the homologue, of the Medusa&rsquo;s action.
If you can fancy an orifice or mouth in the centre of your palm, and
your fingers to be the fringe surrounding the jelly-fish disc, and if
you perform the action indicated in a tub or pool of water, into which
a little flour or fine oatmeal has been thrown to represent the
animalcul&aelig; forming the Medusa&rsquo;s food, so much the better:
you will at once understand how the animalcul&aelig; and food particles
are swept and sucked in by the current created towards the
animal&rsquo;s mouth, or gastric cavity, as it might be more properly
termed. When one or more of these animals comes in contact with a
swimmer&rsquo;s skin, the sensation is anything but agreeable, a
feeling of indescribable loathing and horror being engendered by the
touch of the cold, gelatinous mass, that you are yet conscious is not
dead matter, but an animated pulsating organism. But though contact
with the ordinary Medusa is bad enough, there is another species of
jelly-fish not uncommon in British waters at certain seasons,
accidental contact with which is a very serious matter indeed. These
are known to naturalists as <i lang="la">Acaleph&aelig;</i>, from a
Greek word signifying a nettle. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>are not so numerous
on our shores as the true Medusa, but they grow to a much larger size,
some of them measuring eighteen, twenty, or even twenty-four inches
across the disc, and thick and heavy in proportion, large enough, when
fresh from the sea, to fill a tub of considerable size. If one of these
wretches comes in contact with the human skin, it is found to sting
like a nettle, only much more severely, and hence its scientific name.
A swimmer stung by contact with an acaleph feels not only the cruel
smarting of the nettle-like and burning stinging, but he is in a few
minutes frequently overcome by a feeling of languor and sickness, that
lasts for a considerable time, and is sometimes only relieved by a
violent fit of vomiting, just as if he was a sufferer for the moment
under the influence of a powerful emetic. We have more than once been
stung by an acaleph, and can speak <i>feelingly</i> on the subject.
Only last season a boy on the opposite coast of Appin was, while
bathing, so severely stung by one or more acalephs that he was for some
days confined to bed, seriously ill, and under medical treatment. This
power of stinging seems to be a wise provision in the economy of the
animal, for the purpose of rendering helpless and numbing its prey, to
make them easier of capture and subsequent deglutition, just as the
<i lang="la">Mysotis</i>, or electric eel, with like purpose puts to a
very important and practical use its electro-battery shocks. The true
acaleph may generally be distinguished from the more harmless
jelly-fish by having a good deal of colour in its tissues, being
striated with red, pink, and pale green, which gives it a very
beautiful appearance as under the bright sunlight it floats about,
contracting and expanding with the regularity of a pendulum beat, near
the surface of the calm, unruffled sea. The amount of solid matter in a
jelly-fish of any kind, however large, is amazingly small. Within a
thin, filmy skin, they are entirely made up of water, with a few
threads spider-net-wise running through it to keep it in shape, like
the ropes on which was stretched the immense <i lang="la">velarium</i>
of an ancient amphitheatre. After <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339"
href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>a summer storm we have seen
the sea-beach covered with a considerable wall of jelly-fish that had
been cast ashore, a yard in breadth, perhaps, and a couple of feet in
height; and before the evening of the next day, during which the sun
shone out hot and clear, the whole had melted away like so much snow,
leaving only a thin film of gelatinous matter, which, if gathered
together in a single heap, wouldn&rsquo;t have filled our venerable but
still useful &ldquo;<i>Clachnacuddin</i>&rdquo; hat. There is a good
story told of a farmer, somewhere from the altitudes of
<i>Druimuachdar</i>, who took some land by the sea, not a hundred yards
from our own neighbourhood. One morning he saw the beach covered with a
deep ring of jelly-fish as above, and being an <i>eident</i> body, he
got his horses and carts in order, and commenced to cart them afield,
in the belief that they could not but prove excellent manure for the
land. After working at the job nearly half a day, a naturalist, who
chanced to pass the way, astonished the farmer not a little by assuring
him that some hogsheads of sea-water, <i>and a single
pocket-handkerchief full of manure</i> from the nearest dung-heap,
would fitly and fully represent all that he had on his land in the
fifty odd carts of jelly-fish that had cost him so much labour! The
story goes on to say that that particular farmer looked askance at
jelly-fish ever afterwards, and didn&rsquo;t care much to have their
natural history discussed in his presence at kirk or market, at bridal
or funeral, all his life long. The fact is, that a mass of jelly-fish
sufficient to load the &ldquo;Great Eastern&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t
probably yield a peat creelful of solid serviceable matter for any
purpose or purposes whatever. The jelly-fish is known to the Gaels of
the Hebrides and West Coast by a curious name&mdash;<i lang="gd">Sgeith
an R&oacute;in</i> for the smaller ones, that is, the seal&rsquo;s
vomit, and for the larger ones, <i lang="gd">Sgeith na Muicamara</i>,
the whale&rsquo;s vomit, in the absurd belief that they were the vomits
respectively of the uncanny <i lang="gd">Sealchs</i>, of whom the
Highlander had always a superstitious dread, and of the largest of
marine monsters, after they had gorged themselves <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>to
repletion on a shoal of extra-oleaginous herring or mackerel. These
names for the jelly-fish are doubtless absurd enough, and yet, in
defence of the good old Gaelic name-givers, let us observe that they
are not a whit more absurd than the <i lang="la">Caprimulgus</i>
(goat-sucker) of Linn&aelig;us as applied to the night-jar, or the
<i lang="la">Frugilegus</i> (corn-gatherer) of the same high authority
as applied to the common rook. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The meteorological vaticinations of our weather-wise
octogenarian neighbours have met with abundant and speedy verification
in the storms and heavy rains of the past ten days [October 1876]. For
the month of October, however, the weather continues wonderfully mild;
even with wind and rain the temperature is higher than it usually is at
this date; an occasional fine day, besides, encouraging us in the hope
that winter proper, winter with its thousand discomforts, its snow and
sleet, its cold and cheerlessness and gloom, may be checked in his
advance for some weeks to come, by the uncompromising attitude of an
autumn so lusty of life and bright of eye, but, despite an occasional
overclouding of countenance, it seems yet but only little past its
prime. Agriculturally the season is being wound up satisfactorily
enough; crops have, upon the whole, been secured in very fair
condition, and although the herring fishing in our lochs as elsewhere
has proved a failure, our people are prepared to meet the coming winter
in comparative abundance, and with a cheerfulness calculated to disarm
the gloomy season of more than half its terrors. The poet has
philosophically observed that man</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Wants but little here below,</p>
<p class="line">Nor wants that little long&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">where &ldquo;wants,&rdquo; you will observe, has to be
read in a restricted and peculiar sense: the plain prose of it being,
that for all his essential <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href=
"#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>needs man requires but little,
that merely to live a little suffices, and that, on account of the
shortness and certainty of human life, even that &ldquo;little&rdquo;
is soon dispensed with&mdash;is no longer required. Granted, O Poet!
but not the less true is it that during man&rsquo;s allotted time the
&ldquo;little,&rdquo; however small, is indispensable all the same, and
any sensible diminution or curtailment of his &ldquo;little&rdquo; will
make a man, however abstemious and sober of life, just as miserable as
his fellow who has to bewail the diminution, not of his
&ldquo;little,&rdquo; but of his abundance. Nothing pleases us in our
people here more than their constant cheerfulness in the enjoyment of
their &ldquo;little.&rdquo; They would doubtless take more if they
could get it, and rejoice exceedingly if their &ldquo;little&rdquo;
could be converted into an abundance; but meantime they have the good
sense to be contented, and even happy with what they have, and that,
too, to a degree that no one perhaps less intimate with them than we
are could believe possible in the circumstances.</p>
<p>Our &ldquo;Indian summer,&rdquo; that seems still to linger, as if
loth to leave us to the tender mercies of a winter that is likely to
prove unusually inclement, has been a season of unwonted jubilation to
our wild-birds; for, guided by an instinct that is a monitor
sufficiently to be depended upon in ordinary circumstances, they had
already, each after his kind, prepared themselves, not for equinoctial
warmth and sunshine, but for equinoctial storms. All the more, then,
from its very unexpectedness, did they feel bound to rejoice in the
incalculable blessing of twenty free days of midsummer warmth and calm
at a time when, in the usual course of events, the tempest should have
been howling through the woods and careering over moss and moorland,
they the while glad to cower for shelter and safety in such crevices
and corners as might be best suited to their purpose. At and after the
autumnal equinox, in ordinary seasons, the only one of our native
wild-birds that sings, or attempts to sing, a fairly finished song, is
the redbreast; though, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href=
"#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>to be sure, the wren also
sometimes strikes up an occasional voluntary when we least expect it;
the lively Lilliputian in his song, as in everything else, being a
creature of unbridled impulse, guided solely by the whim and caprice of
the moment, as if in utter contempt and disregard of the method and
order by which other birds are fain to regulate the conduct of their
lives. Not the redbreast alone, however, backed by the intermittent
melodies of the wren, who, Sims Reeves-like, only sings when the humour
seizes him, obstinately silent when you would expect him to sing, and
as obstinately singing when you would expect him to be silent; but the
blackbird also, and chaffinch, the corn bunting and goldfinch, have
been of late delighting us with their music, in volume and compass and
exquisite finish hardly inferior, though so out of season, to their
most successful performances in spring and early summer, which, be it
noted, is <i>the season</i> for wild-bird song at its best. Our poets,
as if by tacit arrangement and preconcert, do all in their power to
impress us with the notion that June is not only the month of flower
and leaf, but the great bird music month as well, a mistake partly
owing, no doubt, to their ignorance of bird life, but mainly, we
suspect, arising from the fact that &ldquo;June&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tune&rdquo; are such pat and perfect rhymes, that the poet
dealing with summer glories and summer joys never fails to pounce upon
them for instant use, without a thought of their inappropriateness, so
far at least as bird music is concerned. It is true that with reference
to bird song our poets are also liberal enough with their
&ldquo;<i>May</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>lay</i>,&rdquo; which, as nearer
to the mark, is somewhat better. Better still, however, would be April,
if our poets would be correct, to which we might perhaps suggest
&ldquo;<i>trill</i>&rdquo; as a rhyme; not a good rhyme to be sure,
even if &ldquo;April&rdquo; could be decently placed at the end of a
line (as in the old &ldquo;valentines&rdquo;) without being
misaccented; but we ornithologists could forgive the halting rhyme and
barbarous accent for the sake of the correctness of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>&ldquo;colouring&rdquo; otherwise. The truth is
that our best wild-bird music time may be set down as properly
belonging to the eight weeks between the 15th March and the 15th May.
Let our poets, then, look out for and find appropriate rhymes for
&ldquo;March,&rdquo; &ldquo;April,&rdquo; and &ldquo;May.&rdquo; It is
their business and not ours; but for any sake, in dealing with
wild-bird music and summer joys, let them beware of the fatal facility
of the rhymes of &ldquo;June&rdquo; and &ldquo;tune.&rdquo; Poets and
poetry apart, however, it was extremely interesting to watch the
conduct of our wild-birds during our late &ldquo;Indian summer.&rdquo;
For the first few days they fluttered about and chirped interrogatively
amongst themselves, as if in a state of doubt and indecision, if not of
actual bewilderment, evidently puzzled what to say to it, but, upon the
whole, of opinion that it was too good to last. Last, however, it did,
longer than either they or we thought at all likely, and before the end
of the week the chirping had developed into actual song, and the
fluttering into a business-like activity, as if they had fully thought
it over, and had decided that it was best, proverb wise, to be making
some hay while the sun shone. Our attention was first of all attracted
by a pair of house sparrows passing and repassing our study window, now
with a stray feather, now with a bit of straw in their bills, with
which they disappeared in a clump of ivy high up on a corner of the
garden wall. On climbing by the aid of a small ladder to inquire what
they were about, we found that they were repairing a nest, in which
they had already reared a brood this season, and which the youngsters,
in their unfledged and awkward babyhood, had considerably damaged and
generally knocked out of shape&mdash;&ldquo;into a cocked hat,&rdquo;
in fact, as they say across the Atlantic. With a care and painstaking,
however, which our &ldquo;featherless biped&rdquo; architects, in
executing <i>their</i> repairs on our stone and lime habitations would
do well to imitate, the sparrows in a surprisingly short time got their
house in order, and in a few days thereafter we found a couple of eggs
in it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>These eggs we took away, for it would only be
cruel to allow a brood to be hatched at this season, only to starve and
die before they could possibly be strong enough of wing to shift for
themselves. And here, in connection with these same sparrow eggs, let
us record a fact that seems to have hitherto escaped the notice of our
oologists (egg-students), even the most lynx-eyed and observant of
them, and it is this: that in the case of such of our wild-birds as
breed more than once in a single season, the eggs of the second laying,
and of the third, if third laying there is&mdash;of all eggs, in short,
dropped after the <i>first</i> laying&mdash;are, as a rule, either
entirely free from spots, or, if they have the spots, they are so faint
as to be scarcely distinguishable. In the case of the sparrow eggs, for
example, taken from the nest as just related, they were perfectly
spotless, pearl-white and clean as they could be. Even under a lens of
considerable power they presented hardly a trace of spot or colouring
in any form. And yet take an egg from a sparrow&rsquo;s nest in early
spring&mdash;from the <i>first</i> laying that is&mdash;and you will
invariably find it to be spotted or blotched with a perfect
constellation, so to speak, round its larger end of greyish and dusky
brown dots and markings. On due examination, we suspect it will be
found to be the same in the case of all our &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; egg
layers; and to this fact, that has been so unaccountably overlooked
hitherto, is to be mainly attributed, we make no doubt, the many
dissensions and disagreements that so frequently have set our best, and
otherwise good-natured, oologists by the ears. In another particular,
too, the eggs of later laying differ from those of the first&mdash;in
the thickness, namely, of the shell; that of the later laying being
thinner and more fragile in the handling. On account of their
fragility, indeed, it is extremely difficult to <i>blow</i> without
damaging an egg of this kind, taken from one of our smaller
bird&rsquo;s nests towards the close of the season. All which, the
faintness of colouring in or total absence of the spots, with the
thinness, transparency, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href=
"#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>and general fragility of the
shell, is doubtless due to an impaired vitality, <i lang="la">quoad
hoc</i>, consequent upon the prodigality of energy thrown into the
loves and labours of rearing the first or spring brood.</p>
<p>On this occasion, too, a pair of blackbirds began a nest <i>de
novo</i>, either despising the labours of mere repairing, or having no
old nest, perhaps, to repair. The blackbirds, however, wiser than the
sparrows, left off before a third&mdash;the lower flat, so to
speak&mdash;of their building was finished; as if they had duly thought
it all over again, and had wisely concluded that it was better to wait
till spring, it being manifestly too late to finish a nest and attempt
to rear a brood any more this season. We fully expected to see the
redbreast, and wren perhaps, also attempt the rearing of an
&ldquo;Indian summer&rdquo; brood; and had they tried, they might,
perhaps, have succeeded, for both birds in such circumstances select
cozy corners about open sheds and out-houses, where they are pretty
safe from the assaults of the weather, and can always find suitable
food in more or less abundance. So far as we could see, however, they
never once thought of anything like love-making or nidification,
contenting themselves with thoroughly enjoying the calm and sunshine
while it lasted, as was abundantly, and, so far as we were concerned,
very delightfully evidenced by the frequency of their loud and
lightsome song.</p>
<p>A recent paragraph in the newspapers about Provost Robertson of
Dingwall, whose daughter was Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s mother, reminds us
of an anecdote which was told us some years ago by the late Mrs.
Morrison of Salachan, in Ardgour, an old lady whose reminiscences of
the people of the Hebrides and mainland of Ross-shire, about the
beginning of the present century, were extremely interesting. Provost
Robertson of Dingwall&mdash;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s grandfather by the
mother&rsquo;s side&mdash;on one occasion paid a visit to London, for
the first, and, we believe, the only time in his life. His friends
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>in the metropolis put him under the charge of a
gentleman, a far-away cousin of his own, who undertook to show him all
the wonders of the great city, and look after him generally. The worthy
Provost was thoroughly Scotch, and dressed after a somewhat
<i>outr&eacute;</i> fashion, <i>&agrave; la</i> Dingwall of the period.
Walking one day along one of the streets of London, a little in advance
of his guide, the worshipful Provost&rsquo;s appearance and <i lang=
"fr">tout ensemble</i> attracted the attention of some half-dozen
street arab boys, who, always ready for a &ldquo;lark,&rdquo; desired
no better pastime for the present than to chaff and poke their fun at
the Chief Magistrate of one of Scotland&rsquo;s most distinguished
northern burghs. The Provost, indignant at the impudence and rudeness
of the young rascals, at last turned round, and, shaking his
silver-headed cane at the offending <i>gamins</i>, exclaimed, in tones
loud enough to be heard by his guide, who was almost choked with
laughter at the scene, &ldquo;Ah, you young vagabonds; if I had you in
Dingwall, wouldn&rsquo;t I make you pay for your
<i>davayrshon!</i>&rdquo; The term &ldquo;diversion&rdquo; was then
used, both in English and Gaelic, all over the Highlands, as indeed it
still is to some extent, in the sense of fun with a backbone of
mischief to it; rough horse-play, in fact, accompanied by what is
now-a-days commonly called <i>chaff</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">This is the 1st of May [1877], sacred in the
ecclesiastical calendar to St. Philip and St. James the Apostles. In
ordinary speech we may now call it summer, we suppose, and it is to be
hoped that it may prove summer indeed, not in name merely, or
astronomically, but veritably, that is, meteorologically as well; such
a summer as delighted our boyhood with its bright sun and cloudless
skies, or with such clouds only as served to modify and temper a
brilliancy and heat that might otherwise have been excessive; the earth
verdant and flower-bespangled under foot and around, the very floods
and trees of the forest, in the grand hyperbole of Scripture,
&ldquo;clapping their hands for joy:&rdquo; the singing of birds the
while, jubilant and joyous, in copse and wild-wood, its fitting bass,
the murmur of innumerable bees; while the fluttering of splendidly
coloured butterflies, as they danced along in many a lawless zig-zag
and merry-go-round, constantly verified and bore witness to the beauty
of the Roman poet&rsquo;s famous line, which may be rendered&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Lo! fluttering past, <i>flowers</i> swimming in
liquid air!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">However the summer may turn out, of the spring at
least but little good&mdash;speaking of course
meteorologically&mdash;can be said. It was, <i lang="la">quoad hoc</i>,
an imposture, and nothing else, and always reminding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>us
of Hood&rsquo;s wicked parody on the opening lines of Thomson&rsquo;s
big and bow-wow invocation to the season:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Come, gentle Spring, ethereal
mildness, come!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line xd26e1751">O, Thomson, void of sense as well as
reason;</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Why in our ears such arrant nonsense drum?</p>
<p class="line xd26e1751">There&rsquo;s no such season!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To housewives in rural districts we offer a
&ldquo;wrinkle&rdquo; that may be found of use at the present season,
when most vegetable gardens may be ransacked in vain for delicacies
that shall be common enough at a later period. While rambling through
the district a few days ago, we chanced to drop in upon a widow lady
and daughter, who occupy a nice little cottage. They were going to sit
down to an early dinner, and although we were not very hungry, and
could have fasted till a later hour, not merely without inconvenience,
but from choice, yet on their earnest invitation we sat down along with
them. The fare consisted of soup and a boiled fowl, the latter fat,
tender, and good as a fowl should always be, and the soup was simply
delicious. A green vegetable of some kind floating thickly in it, gave
it a relish and <i>gout</i> that was very remarkable, and we asked what
it was. &ldquo;Nettle-tops, sir,&rdquo; was the answer, and had we not
been told, it is probable that we should have guessed and blundered
long ere we could hit upon it. But not only can nettle-tops be thus
utilised as an admirable condiment in soup at this season, but they may
also be served up asparagus-wise, and, to our taste, are every whit as
good. In this latter form we have eaten them often, and, as Johnson
said, after swallowing several platefuls of Scotch broth, in reply to
Boswell&rsquo;s observation&mdash;&ldquo;You never ate it
before?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir, but I don&rsquo;t care how soon I eat it
again.&rdquo; And so say we invariably when we have finished a dish of
nettle-top asparagus. After our nettle-top soup it occurred to us that
there might be more truth in Goldsmith&rsquo;s remark about the French
than he was perhaps aware of, for he meant it as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>satire, that they can roast a sirloin if they
only had beef, and prepare &ldquo;ten different dishes from
nettle-tops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had occasion to be up and about very early this morning, not,
however, for the purpose of washing our face in May dew, although the
morning was very beautiful, and the dew lay plentiful enough, and
pearl-like on grass and birchen bough, but in order to go on what some
may think an even sillier errand, to wit, a birds&rsquo;-nesting. For
this sort of thing the earlier the hour the better at this season, and
as we mounted the coppiced slopes which we proposed searching, the sun
was beginning to gild the loftiest peaks of Glencoe with purple and
amber and gold, and all the cocks in the hamlet, as if at a
preconcerted signal, were cheerily greeting the rising god, or if their
thoughts were more mundane and prosaic, as perhaps they were, you may
interpret the crowing of each individual chanticleer as some one else
did before you in some such lines as these&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cock rose in the morning;</p>
<p class="line">He called his favourite hen,</p>
<p class="line">With a cockle-do-doo, and a how-d&rsquo;ye-do,</p>
<p class="line">And how-d&rsquo;ye-do again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the economy of birds, the most important labours
are those of nest-building and incubation; and owing to the wintriness
of the spring, we were quite prepared this morning to find matters in a
decidedly backward state throughout the length and breadth of
bird-land, wherever we might wander. We were not, however, prepared to
find things in anything like the sad plight in which we actually found
them; for in no district of the remotest Highlands, we venture to say,
are the agricultural labours proper to man at this season so backward
as are their own proper labours this year amongst our native
wild-birds. Usually at this date nine-tenths of our birds have already
completed the labours of nidification, and with some species even
incubation is far advanced, if not actually <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>completed. The results of our morning&rsquo;s
ornithological ramble may be very briefly stated. Of thirteen nests
discovered, four only contained eggs, and even of these four only one
had its proper complement, that of a song-thrush, namely, which
contained five bonny blue eggs, spotted with black at the larger end, a
number rarely, if ever, exceeded. In a merle or blackbird&rsquo;s nest
there were only two eggs, instead of the usual complement of four or
five. A chaffinch&rsquo;s nest had only one egg, whereas four is the
proper number; while in the nest of a greenfinch, there was also only
one egg instead of five, and that one, from certain signs known only to
the initiated, we decided had only been laid yesterday, or even early
this morning&mdash;perhaps shortly before our visit. Of the remaining
nests, a few were fairly completed, and ready for their egg treasures
at any time, but the greater number were only partially finished, and
in their unfinished state had suffered so much from sleet and wind and
rain, that we much doubt if their builders will have anything more to
do with them, for it is a curious fact, that with such rare exceptions
as only serve to accentuate and emphasise the rule, all birds prefer
building a new nest from the very foundation to occupying an old one,
or making the slightest repairs on one that has met with any serious
injury. And this, too, you will please observe&mdash;a bird never
improves in his architecture and never declines. He builds to-day
neither better nor worse than did his ancestors a thousand or five
thousand years ago. The sense or instinct that taught him to build of
certain materials and of a certain form, long before Homer was born or
Troy was besieged, is the same sense or instinct still. Nothing added;
nothing subtracted. From all we have seen, we should say that the
annual addition to bird life in our country will be considerably
smaller than the average. Even first broods will be so late that second
hatching is out of the question. Bird-song, however, will last longer
into the summer, and begin again earlier in autumn than in ordinary
seasons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=

<p>On a dull day last week we were routed out of our study by a visit
from Professor Geikie, who, accompanied by some half-dozen others, was
geologising in the districts of Appin and Lochaber. In such a place as
this, it was impossible but that they should find much to interest them
geologically and otherwise; and we were glad to hear them all say that
they were much delighted with their wanderings. An occasional invasion
of this kind, sometimes, too, when you least expect it, never fails to
do one good. It makes you, <i lang="la">nolens volens</i>, shake
yourself clear, as best you may, of the accumulated cobwebs of months,
and you return to your ordinary work not a little invigorated and
refreshed by having had an opportunity of comparing notes, rubbing
shoulders, and even crossing blades&mdash;in all friendship of
course&mdash;with foemen worthy of your steel.</p>
<p>A lady correspondent writes us from London as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I was much pleased with your reference to the old
pipe tune. The music I have long known, but the origin and history of
the piece was unknown to me, nor had I ever heard any of the words
attached to it. I agree with you that all such scraps of information
should be collected and preserved, adding so largely as they do to the
interest with which we Highlanders must always regard our national
melodies. I need not, of course, ask <i>you</i> if you know the very
fine pipe tune &lsquo;Macrimmon&rsquo;s Lament,&rsquo; <i lang="gd">Cha
till mi tuilleadh</i>. When I was a girl in the Hebrides&mdash;I am
afraid to say how many years ago&mdash;I often heard the following
story associated with this tune. In the island of Mull there is a large
cave which in popular belief reaches right across the island from the
east shore to the west. This cave, in the old times, was inhabited, so
ran the tradition, by a colony of wolves and other wild animals. No man
in consequence had ever the courage to explore its dark labyrinthine
windings. At a wedding party assembled in a hamlet in the neighbourhood
of the cave, its vastness and many dangers became <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>the
subject of conversation. All agreed that no human being could possibly
pass through it and live. The piper of the district was a very brave
man as well as an admirable piper, and in an evil hour for himself, as
it proved, he offered for some slight wager to traverse the cave from
side to side of the island, with a pine torch stuck in the front of his
bonnet to give him light, and playing the pipes all the time. The piper
thereupon entered the cave, playing a lively march, while most of the
wedding guests followed above, led in the proper course by the music,
which could be heard faintly from below. More than half the cave was
traversed, when suddenly the music changed from a brisk march to a
doleful lament. This lament, duly interpreted, told the people above
that things were becoming uncomfortable with the piper; first, that the
pine torch was almost burnt out, and again that his breath was failing
him, while the boldest of the wolves slowly retired before him, only
kept at bay by the flickering of the torch and the sound of the pipes,
but ready to spring upon and devour him the instant the torch should be
extinguished and the music of the pipes should cease. It was then that
the doomed piper played <i lang="gd">Cha till mi tuilleadh&rsquo;</i>
so mournfully&mdash;&lsquo;I will return no more!&rsquo; And this
too&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="gd" class="lg">

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">(&lsquo;Alas, and my great want, that I have not

<p class="line xd26e978">Two for (playing) the pipes, and one to wield

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">If he had only a third hand he thought he could manage
to kill the wolves that were every instant becoming bolder, as if they
knew he must fall into their jaws at last. The last notes caught by the
people above were known to mean&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=

<p>And then the music ceased, and they knew that the poor piper had
been torn to pieces by the wolves. Such is something like the story I
used to hear in connection with the big cave in Mull and the well-known
lament, more than fifty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cave referred to is on the estate of Lochbuy. So far as it has
been explored, its length is over 500 feet, with a breadth of some 25
feet, and a height of 40. It is proper to say that the people of Skye
claim the whole story as belonging to their island. The piper was a
Macrimmon; the cave is pointed out near Dunvegan, and the story of the
wolves and the piper&rsquo;s sad fate is just as likely to be true of
the one island as of the other. Our own opinion is, that so far as
there is any truth in the story, it must be located in Skye rather than
in Mull, although our friends in the latter island will perhaps be
angry with us for saying so. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href=

<p class="first">Rain in Lochaber&mdash;An Apple Tree in bloom by
Candle-light&mdash;Mackenzie the Bird-Catcher&mdash;A Badenoch
&ldquo;Wise Woman&rdquo; spitting in a Child&rsquo;s Face to preserve

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;It never rains but it pours,&rdquo; and nowhere
is the familiar adage in its utmost literalness truer than in Lochaber.
During a long protracted drought of nearly a couple of months&rsquo;
duration [June 1877], we were constantly calling for rain; and no
wonder, for the earth was hard and hide-bound as an Egyptian mummy;
sheep and cattle finding little more to gather on the parched uplands
than if they were nibbling at the bulge of an ironclad laid up in
ordinary. For full five and twenty years&mdash;so far back, <i>eheu</i>
and alas! do our own individual meteorological records extend&mdash;we
have had no May month so persistently ungenial and cold; nor, when one
comes to think of it, is it much matter of surprise, for we have just
been reading that in the North Atlantic, within a few hundred leagues
of the British shores, and up to the very margin of the Gulf Stream, a
ship recently arrived in port had to fight her way through quite a
continent of drift ice, with occasional icebergs &ldquo;from two to
three hundred feet in height.&rdquo; With such grim, hyperborean
neighbours on the one hand, and a keen-edged east wind on the other, it
was impossible that it should be otherwise than cold and uncomfortable
all round. On the 26th, however, came the long-looked-for change, the
wind came slowly round to S.S.W., rain began to fall, and the effect
was magical. There was instantly a blanket-like kindliness and a
balminess in the air that was delicious. The birds, that a little
before could only chirp dolorously, burst out into loud and jubilant
song, the cattle lowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href=
"#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>in their pastures, wild-flowers
seemed to laugh with quiet delight, and the very boom of the big waves
as they broke on the beach had a pleasant music in it. It has continued
to rain more or less ever since, so that with regard to mere personal
comfort one is ready to cry &ldquo;Hold, enough!&rdquo; but so far as
the interests of agriculture and pasturage are concerned, not a drop
too much has fallen. The fact is that, frequent as is the complaint
about what people are pleased to speak about as our superabundant
rainfall, we require it all. We question if a diminution of our annual
rainfall by a third, say, or even by a fifth of its amount, would, from
a practical and utilitarian point of view, be any improvement, but the
reverse. A shrewd south country shepherd, with whom we had a long crack
on Saturday, was right when, speaking of the rain, he remarked that
&ldquo;it would be a puir country for sheep at ony rate, if we had much
less o&rsquo;t frae year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end.&rdquo; How
ill the drought of April and May agreed with us here may be understood
from the fact that there was an unusual amount of sickness amongst the
people; while the leanness of sheep and kine bore sad and emphatic
witness to the scarcity of succulent pasture, and the general
backwardness of the season is to this moment noticeable from our window
as we write, for neither the lilac nor the hawthorn is yet in bloom,
nor are potatoes, even the earliest planted, any more than just
becoming discernible in regular drills. We should say that vegetation
is generally quite a fortnight later than usual, and only an
exceptionally fine summer and early autumn can bring about a fairly
seasonable harvest-time. <i lang="la">Dum spiro, spero</i>, however, is
a good maxim, and we shall hope that, even if harvest is late, the
ingathering may be all the more pleasant and abundant. The drought,
however, and persistent east wind, it is but fair to confess, were
rather favourable than otherwise to the fruit trees of all kinds in
garden and orchard. Bud and blossom were, to use a military term, held
in check until after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357"
name="pb357">357</a>]</span>the middle of May, thus escaping the night
frosts usual in the early part of the month. All sorts of fruit trees
and berry bushes are consequently only now in full bloom, and a large
fruit crop may very confidently be looked for, though it may be a
little later than usual in attaining to perfect ripeness. Did you ever,
by the way, good reader, look at an apple tree in full blossom on a
calm, dewy night by candle-light? Recently we had occasion to go into
our garden towards midnight in search of a bird that had escaped from
his cage during the day. Coming under a large apple tree in full bloom,
we held up the open lantern in our hand and peered a-tiptoe among the
branches in hopes of getting a sight of the foolish runaway. Him we did
not find then, but the apple tree, bending under its weight of blossoms
&ldquo;dew besprent,&rdquo; was the most beautiful thing we ever saw,
and we called everybody about the place to come and look at it, and
they all agreed that the sight was as beautiful as it was new to them.
If you have an opportunity try it for yourself, and you will thank us
all your life long for calling your attention to a thing of beauty,
which the poet is not wrong in assuring you &ldquo;is a joy for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get our bird in the apple tree, but we were in great
good luck notwithstanding, for who chanced to come the way next morning
but Mackenzie the bird-catcher, who soon discovered the runaway&rsquo;s
whereabouts in a neighbouring copse, and whistled him back to hand as
easily as a shepherd whistles back his truant collie. It is a
goldfinch, a magnificent singer, whom we have long had as a cage-bird;
and being unaccustomed to liberty, it was all the easier enticing him
back to his cage, although we much doubt if any man in the kingdom
could have done it so immediately and with such unfaltering confidence
in his own power to do it as Mackenzie, who knows wild-bird music
better than any one else we ever met, and can imitate it in its every
twist and turn, chirp or cheep or chant, so deftly and unmistakeably as
to deceive the birds themselves, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358"
href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>each after his kind, the
severest test to which such an accomplishment could be put. If there be
any truth in the old doctrine of metempsychosis, Mackenzie, having
shaken off the &ldquo;mortal coil&rdquo; of his present form, is pretty
sure to reappear as a rock-linnet, redpole, or goldfinch. Like an
honest man, who knows and acknowledges the value and force of an Act of
Parliament, he hadn&rsquo;t on this occasion much to show us, but what
he had was in part at least interesting, and captured in early spring.
One curiosity was a linnet with one wing pure white, which he would
insist upon was a different species from the ordinary linnet, because
he had caught so many with a sinister or dexter, one or other, wing
white or variegated. We fought a hard battle in trying to convince him
that it was a mere accidental bit of colouring, due probably to some
hurt received in its downy days, or at all events before its first
moult; and made it no more a different species than an accidental hurt,
which causes a man to go lame, makes him anything else than a specimen
of <i lang="la">homo sapiens</i> all the same. Arguing, however, with
men of Mackenzie&rsquo;s stamp is rather uphill work. He listened, to
be sure, with a politeness and attention which seems to us to be
inseparable from the character of the true practical naturalist, and
seemed to give acquiescence in all we asserted, but we shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder a bit if he remained of his own opinion still. A rather rare
bird was a specimen, in excellent condition and feather, of the grey
crow, at one time quite a common bird along the shores of the West
Highlands, but owing to the incessant war waged against them by
shepherds, gamekeepers, and vermin-trappers, now become so rare that we
stopped our pony to have a good look at a pair that we saw the other
day near Strontian, at the head of Loch Sunart. If you want a specimen
of any British bird, just commission Mackenzie to get it for you. He
will only bring you a specimen that is perfect of its kind, and if you
only give him time he will succeed in getting it, even if he walked a
thousand miles in the pursuit. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359"

<p>With reference to our explanation of the term <i>study</i> applied

<p>A gentleman from Badenoch greatly amused us the other day by his
account of a certain superstitious observance on the part of a
&ldquo;wise woman&rdquo; in his neighbourhood. The gentleman&rsquo;s
wife was sitting with her baby, only a few weeks old, in her lap. It
was of course a marvel of a baby; for bigness and beauty the finest
baby, like <i>all</i> babies, that ever was seen, and of which its

The &ldquo;wise woman&rdquo; of the place had called to see the child,
and congratulated the parents on their good luck. The crone got a chair
opposite to that occupied by the happy mother, while the father looked
on and smiled with becoming dignity and pride. As the old woman was
looking at the child, it chanced to yawn, bored probably by the amount
of attention paid to it, and getting sleepy. As it yawned, the old
woman got up from the chair, and walking over to the &ldquo;infant
phenomenon,&rdquo; coolly and deliberately spat in its face! The mother
was horrified; the father in a rage asked what the deuce she meant by
spitting in <i>his</i> son&rsquo;s face? The old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>lady
quietly answered that the yawn was owing to an evil influence at that
moment at work with the child, and her spitting in its face was the
readiest and most effectual way of saving it from one or more of the
mischievous tricks which ill-natured fairies are so fond of playing off
on babies that are &ldquo;beautiful exceedingly,&rdquo; and more
especially when they are overmuch petted and bepraised by their parents
and friends. The &ldquo;wise woman&rdquo; was at once liberally
supplied with the refreshments usual on such occasions, and as soon as
possible dismissed, care being taken the while not to offend her, which
might have been a serious matter for baby and all concerned. It is not
a little curious that although in all countries to spit at one is
expressive of the utmost detestation and contempt, yet in the
superstitions of the Lowlands of Scotland, as well as in the Highlands,
to spit on a person or thing, under certain conditions and
circumstances, is supposed to be counteractive of evil influences, and
therefore a highly commendable act. We have seen a woman spit on the
nets in a boat as it left the shore, to ensure a successful fishing;
and when hand-line fishing, a man who has had little luck and is
getting impatient, as he baits his hook afresh, spits on it before
dropping it again into the sea, in the belief that good luck attends
the act. An old woman who has just bound up a bruised or broken limb,
whether of man or beast, will sometimes finish the operation by
spitting on the bandage. In the superstitions of most countries, such
involuntary and apparently causeless acts as sneezing and yawning are
attributed to supernatural agencies, and spitting at the sneezer or
yawner is still sometimes practised as a counter-charm by the oldest
and most learned professors of such lore, an older superstition
probably than the more common practice of invoking the Divine blessing
on the subjects in such cases. Questionable, therefore, and rude as at
first sight seemed the act, we assured our Badenoch friend that the
&ldquo;wise woman,&rdquo; in acting as she did, meant his bairn no evil
or disrespect at all, but the very contrary. <span class=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The reader may remember that we concluded our last
with a hopeful and jubilant note, believing that really fine
weather&mdash;a long track of it, perhaps&mdash;was just at hand. We
much regret having to say that our meteorological vaticinations proved
utterly incorrect. It still rains [July 1877], not constantly, indeed,
but with sufficient persistence to make everybody miserable, and to
reduce our hopes of a good harvest almost to zero. Yesterday, for
example, we had occasion to cross the Loch in our boat. It was a nice
bright day enough at starting, with a fresh breeze from N.W., which
carried us along at racing pace. All of a sudden the heavens became
black and threatening; a terrible squall almost capsized us ere we had
time to sing out to our companion to let go &ldquo;everything by the
run.&rdquo; He did, fortunately, let go just in time, and grasping an
oar ourselves, and calling on him to take another, we had her head
turned to the wind and waves as quietly but as quickly as possible.
Thus we held her, just like a horse by the reins, while the squall
lasted, and cunningly took advantage of its drift to get to the Appin
shore. We managed to reach it, but in very sorry plight, as you shall
hear. With the squall had come rain, literally the <i>heaviest</i> we
ever saw, which drenched us to the skin; every drop big enough to fill
as it fell the largest of thimbles, and driven by the squall, remember,
it fell with the force of a spent bullet. As &ldquo;drookit&rdquo; and
drenched we landed, and crawled with all the miserable, and woebegone,
and shambling gait of the really <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362"
href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>and thoroughly
through-and-through wet, you would have laughed in the teeth of all the
rain had you only met us; and we much doubt if any one who did not know
us would just then have been disposed to appraise ourselves and our
whole belongings at the value of a much bigger coin of the realm than a
shabby florin. And this is just the sort of weather it continues to be.
You cannot depend upon it for an hour. It is sunshine and blue above
just for five minutes; it is all of a sudden gloomy and black as
Erebus, and raining so multitudinously that you are fain to draw the
skirts of your coat anyhow over your head and run for the nearest
shelter. When we are to have better weather let the meteorologists, who
ought to know, say.</p>
<p>There is an old and frequent proverb, though rarely heard
now-a-days, to the effect that &ldquo;there goes reason to the roasting
of eggs,&rdquo; the meaning of which, as we apprehend it, is that the
smallest culinary operation is of importance, and should be gone about
with judgment and care. If the proverb, however, in its actual words,
as a mere popular saw, is very much forgotten, it is a good sign of our
time that its spirit at least is in this our own day claiming no little
attention, as the establishment of &ldquo;cookery classes,&rdquo; and
the praiseworthy attempts to disseminate culinary lore amongst the
people, abundantly testify. It has been said that the man who makes two
blades of grass to grow where only one blade grew before is a
benefactor to his species, and equally so, would we venture to assert,
is he a benefactor to the human race who shows how any single article
of food, usually cooked and served in an unsatisfactory and tasteless
fashion, may, with no extra expense and little extra trouble, be made
palatable and savoury. The other day, landing from our boat, we went
into a cottar&rsquo;s house close by the sea, in a neighbouring
district, just as the gudewife was preparing the family dinner. A pot
of new potatoes was boiling on the fire, and as she knew that it would
take us still some time to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href=
"#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>get home, she very good-naturedly
invited us to wait a little and take a share with herself and her
husband of the dinner about to be served, a bit of hospitality as
frankly accepted as it was kindly offered. Looking now and again into
the boiling potato pot, and <i>listening</i> with inclined ear to the
sound, actually <i>musical</i> in such a case, of its boil and
bubbling, she was ready at the proper instant to snatch it off the
fire, and, carrying it to a corner of the kitchen, she poured off the
water, and immediately re-hung it over the fire again, shortening the
chain by which it was suspended by a link or two, that the fire might
not, now that it was waterless, have too much effect upon it. She then
got some half-dozen fresh herrings, caught early that
morning&mdash;herrings large, and beautiful, and silvery scaled as a
salmon&mdash;and drying them nicely with a cloth, she placed them
flat-wise side by side on the top of the potatoes in the pot, the lid
of which she was careful to make fit tightly by means of a coarse
kitchen towel, which served at once to cover the contents, and to cause
the lid to fit so tightly that all the steam was effectually retained.
For the time being, in short, the pot by this ready expedient may be
said to have been hermetically sealed. During a quarter of an hour,
perhaps, and while the gentleman and ourselves carried on a lively
conversation, the wife kept an attentive eye on the pot, never once
lifting the lid, however, but from time to time raising or lowering a
link of the chain as in her judgment was necessary. All being ready at
last, she took the pot off the fire, and set it on a low stool in the
middle of the floor. She then lifted the lid and the cloth, and the
room was instantly filled with a savoury steam that made one&rsquo;s
mouth water merely to inhale it. Occupying each a low chair, we were
invited to fall to, to eat without knife, or fork, or trencher, just
with our fingers out of the pot as it stood. It was a little startling,
but only for a moment. After a word of grace we dipped our hand into
the pot, and took out a potato hot and mealy, and with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>the
other we took a nip out of the silvery flank of the herring nearest us.
It was a mouthful for a king, sir! We have in our day a thousand times
dined well and heartily both at home and abroad, but we greatly
question if we ever enjoyed a dinner half so much as <i>that</i>. The
savouriness of that potato and herring feast will haunt us till our
dying day. What struck us was simply this: A new potato and fresh
herring as usually served is something terribly insipid; as we got it
that day it was a meal for an emperor. We actually felt inclined to
lick our fingers after every mouthful, than which surely there could be
no higher praise of any food whatever. Let such of our readers as have
the opportunity just try a potato and herring cooked in the manner
stated, eating it digitally, with their own proper fingers, and they
will thank us, if they are honest, for bringing so savoury and
delicious a dish to their knowledge.</p>
<p>One of the finest glens in all the West Highlands is Glen Nevis,
which, opening out in the direction of the old Castle of Inverlochy,
extends eastwards and inland, the valley gradually narrowing into glen
and gorge as you proceed, for nine or ten miles, presenting at every
turn and standpoint throughout its many windings a succession of the
most striking and beautiful pictures imaginable, so striking and
startling at times, and <i>new</i> at least in some of their details,
that a genuine lover of mountain scenery wishes that he could devote an
entire day to every separate mile of its extent, rather than have to
hurry through it all in something like half a dozen hours, which is the
way the thing is usually done. It is like being dragged, as happened to
us once, by a nervous and impatient lady friend of ours, at a sort of
half trot through a picture gallery, where, if you had your own way,
you would gladly lounge and linger till the custodier of the place,
perhaps, came respectfully to hint that the afternoon was far advanced,
and that shutting-up time was at hand. With the entrance to Glen Nevis,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>as far as the mansion-house, we had long been
familiar, and once at least we had a bird&rsquo;s-eye glance into the
glen proper itself, from the summit of <i>Dundearduil</i>, which we had
approached from the south in order to examine its curious and still
inexplicable vitrifications. It was not, however, till Friday last,
that we had an opportunity of thoroughly exploring the glen through all
its windings, and coming with little difficulty to the conclusion
already expressed, that of all our West Highland glens, it is, perhaps,
the most beautiful and (Glencoe always apart) the most deserving of a
thorough and leisurely examination. We were fortunate in having hit
upon a highly favourable day&mdash;not too bright, for glaring sunshine
and unclouded brightness amongst mountain scenery is a great
mistake&mdash;and no less fortunate in our companions, each one of them
blessed with eyes that, open, could really see, and hearts that, duly
appealed to, could truly feel; who knew full well what they had come to
do, and from first to last did it admirably. Barely, we should say, has
the noble glen exposed its stern grandeur and innumerable beauties
under favourable skies, to the glad and earnest gaze of more
intelligently appreciative spectators; and more rarely still, perhaps,
have the splendid falls of the Nevis borne burden to peals of honester
or merrier laughter than we indulged in as over the well-plenished
luncheon basket we fortified ourselves for the ascent of the upper
gorges,&mdash;a somewhat &ldquo;stiff&rdquo; climb, but neither really
difficult nor dangerous. When we say that at Glen Nevis House our party
was joined by Mr. Macpherson&mdash;<i lang="gd">fear a ghlinne e
f&eacute;in</i>, the goodman of the glen <i>himself</i>, as the
Highlanders say&mdash;who kindly accompanied us throughout, and to whom
every foot of the glen was as familiar as the floor of his own
dining-room, many of our readers will understand how really pleasant
and enjoyable, <i lang="la">c&oelig;teris paribus</i>, must have been
our upland wanderings on that delightful day.</p>
<p>We have no intention of entering on anything like a minute or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>photographic description of Glen Nevis, for
which, indeed, half-a-dozen Nether Lochaber columns would hardly
suffice; we can only hurriedly glance at what most instantly and
indelibly struck us in the day&rsquo;s excursion. First of all, we were
all struck by the exceeding pellucidity and crystal clearness of the
waters of the Nevis. Nowhere else did we ever see a mountain stream so
beautifully transparent. Standing on the brink of any selected pool,
many feet in depth, you distinguished the smallest pea-sized pebble,
its veins, scratches, and striations, as distinctly as if you had it on
the palm of your hand, under a lens, and within less than a foot focus
of your eyeball! And all this remarkable pellucidity, observe, not in
one particular pool, or in any one particular stretch of the river, but
throughout all its beautiful windings. Another remarkable feature of
the glen is the manner in which its natural birch woods grow. They
occupy a pretty broad belt almost half-way up the mountains, leaving a
still broader belt between themselves and the river banks comparatively
bare and treeless. In all the other Highland glens with which we have
any acquaintance, whatever of wood there is always begins, as seems
most natural, at the river banks, where it is thickest and most
luxuriant, growing away and upwards on either side to a greater or less
altitude, according to the nature of the soil and the shelter to be had
from the prevailing winds. And speaking of winds, this is the place to
observe that of all our glens Glen Nevis is perhaps the stormiest, the
wind in a gale not blowing steadily, but in fitful gusts and
whirlwind-wise, striking in from the corries right and left, and
meeting in the centre with a force and fury unimaginable by
non-residenters. How do you know, the reader may ask, for it was calm
and quiet enough during <i>your</i> visit on Friday? True, and yet we
failed not to notice a very striking proof of the storminess at times
of Glen Nevis notwithstanding. As you pass the forester&rsquo;s house
at Auchreoch, lift up your eyes, and please observe how <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>carefully, how thoroughly, closely, compactly,
and painstakingly it is thatched; and observe further and over all a
network of wire as thick and strong as that used in our overland
telegraphy, and to the end of each wire as it almost reaches the ground
in front and at the back of the house, please notice suspended a large
stone, water-worn boulders from the river below, each of a
hundredweight or more, and you will not fail, we think, to understand
how we so confidently decided that Glen Nevis at times must be an
exceedingly stormy place. If you assert that other Highland glens may
be quite as stormy in the season of storms, we shall not contradict
you; what we do say is this, that never did a house-roof speak to us so
eloquently of furious and frequent storm and whirlwind as did the roof
of that house at Auchreoch, and a very good house it is, and a very
pretty place to the bargain. A little beyond Auchreoch, and to the left
of the path, there is a bit of wild and rugged rock scenery well worth
attention. Here and there, over the face of what seems the hard
impenetrable rock, many trees grow and flourish as if through the very
heart of the granite. The explanation of course is, that the rock which
seems so homogeneous and solid at a distance is in reality fissured and
fractured in all directions, and that in these fissures the trees find
soil and food enough to sustain a wonderfully luxuriant growth and
opulence of foliage for such a situation. About a mile further up the
glen, we separated from our companions for a while, we having
determined to cross the Nevis at this point in order to visit <i lang=
"gd">Uaimh Shomhairle</i>, or Samuel&rsquo;s Cave, the entrance to
which was pointed out to us by Mr. Macpherson in the face of the
opposite steep. To get across the river we had to strip until in a
state of almost <i lang="la">puris naturalibus</i>, and even then it
was somewhat dangerous, a single false step might have been attended by
very serious consequences. With a little circumspection and care,
however, we got safely over, and half-dressed and barefooted we climbed
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>rock like a chamois, and in less than ten
minutes we were standing at the mouth of the celebrated cave.
Samuel&rsquo;s Cave is in fact <i>two</i> caves, the outer and smaller
one, with a broad portal that admits abundant light and air, forming a
sort of vestibule or antechamber to the inner cave. Provided with one
or two old newspapers and some wax vestas, we improvised a couple of
rude torches which we carried with us as we crept through a narrow
opening by which alone access is obtained into the inner <i>antrum</i>.
Lighting one of these torches, which answered our purpose quite well
enough, we explored the cave at leisure, closely scrutinising the walls
and roof as high as we could reach, in the hope of perhaps finding some
scratch or sculptures, however rude, to prove that the place had been
inhabited in the times of the &ldquo;cave-men.&rdquo; Nothing of the
kind, however, was discernible. The cave in its every part is
exceedingly damp and cold, with green, slimy roof and walls, where not
even the hardiest wild beast of mountain or forest would think of
taking up its abode, far less any human being with the faintest notion
of the value of warmth and comfort. There are scores of lesser caves
and fissures in the rocks around where one would elect to live by
reason of their dryness, in preference to the big and pretentious
Samuel&rsquo;s Cave, which, as a mere cave, is perhaps interesting
enough, and not unworthy of a visit; otherwise it is a
&ldquo;sell,&rdquo; in exploring which no one can spend more than the
shortest five minutes to any good purpose. In the times of civil wars
and clan feuds it is conceivable that one or more outlawed and
&ldquo;broken&rdquo; men might find the outer cave a secure and not
altogether unpleasant place of shelter to pass a night in where no
better might be. As a place also to hide one&rsquo;s more valuable
goods and chattels in an emergency, the cave may at times have had its
value and use. It never, depend upon it, was <i>inhabited</i> for any
length of time by any human being. A week of it would kill the
stoutest, robustest savage that ever trod the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>Caledonian wilds. An additional proof, if
additional proofs are wanting, that Samuel&rsquo;s Cave can never have
been &ldquo;inhabited&rdquo; in any proper sense of that term, or even
much frequented for any purpose whatever, is to be found in the fact
that there is not a vestige of a path either from the river bank below
or from the hill above leading towards it. Had it at any time been much
in use for any purpose, there must have been a path leading to it
either from above or from below, and some traces at least, however
faint, of such a path, must still exist. We searched and searched,
above and below, and round and round, and no trace or vestige at all of
such a path could we find. Go, good reader, and see the cave by all
means when you have the opportunity; it is a fair enough cave as caves
go; but take our word for it that the attempt to invest the vast dark,
damp, slimy <i>antrum</i> with any arch&aelig;ological interest is the
greatest delusion in the world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The weather continues wonderfully fine for the season
[October 1877], and with the exception of the potato-lifting, all our
harvest labours are at length concluded. The ingathering has upon the
whole been highly satisfactory, far more so than any one could have had
the courage to predict up to the very advent of this our autumnal
summer, which has already lasted just thirty days, uninterruptedly
sunny and dry, without any more serious break than a mere passing
shower, which invariably did more good than harm. More good? the reader
exclaims interrogatively, how can a shower do good, how can it be
otherwise than harmful in harvest time? Patience, courteous reader, and
we shall explain. It is a case of something of this kind. You are
driving along the road; the horse in the shafts before you is upon the
whole a steady-going and willing animal enough, but you have let him
have it just his own way for the last half hour, and dreaming, perhaps,
of fresh fields and pastures green, he has for the moment forgotten
your existence, and begins to lag. His usual pace of a good eight miles
an hour is now hardly over five, and what in such a case shall you do?
You drop the lash gently across his flank, as light and gently as falls
the angler&rsquo;s cast on the waveless pool; you are too much of a
Christian and a gentlemen&mdash;the terms are or ought to be
synonymous&mdash;to do otherwise until it is absolutely necessary. Your
horse forgets his dream; becomes instantly alive to the work
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>before him; gathers himself together, and with a
responsive toss of his head and a lively play of ears, goes along at
rather more than his average speed until the next stage is reached;
knowing full well that the hand that laid on that serpent-like lash so
tenderly, can lay it on in very different fashion, hot and heavy enough
when occasion calls. Or, dropping metaphor, let us state the matter
plainly, thus:&mdash;Here in Lochaber, and we suppose it is just the
same over all the Highlands, when really fine weather comes, we are for
the first few days up and doing, busy enough. But as one fine day
succeeds another, we are very ready to fall into the error that after
all it is best to take things leisurely. Where&rsquo;s the need, we ask
ourselves, for so much hurry and bustle? The fine weather has lasted a
week; it may last a month, is indeed likely so to last; it is no more
like rain to-day than it was yesterday; and thus we lapse, often
unconsciously, perhaps, into a spirit of dilatoriness and
procrastination, out of which only a lowering sky, and a shower that
for all we know may become a flood, can fairly rouse us. You slept
long, for instance, this morning; you dawdled over your porridge and
milk at breakfast time, and it is now noonday. But see! the heavens
yonder in the north-west are suddenly overcast; an ominous gloom creeps
over the Outer Hebrides; a few drops of rain have already fallen, one
on the back of your left hand, on which placing the index finger of
your right, you can find that it is wet, that it is rain; a second on
your cheek with a soft, tepid thud; and a third right into your open,
uplifted eye, and you straightway start into activity and life. All
hands on deck! is the cry. You rush into the field amongst the stooks;
you bustle about cheerily, and calling all hands into your service, for
idlers are now out of place, you cart and carry away as fast as you can
into your barn or stack-yard, and by sunset, so expeditiously have you
worked, that the field from head-rig to head-rig is but bare and
stookless stubble. It was after all but a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>passing shower; the
gloom has given place to cloudless blue; you have been cheated, so to
speak. But what matters it? Your crop is safely stacked or housed, and
were it not for the passing shower and temporary mid-day gloom, your
stooks were still afield, running a risk there was no reason they
should run; and so, good reader, you will understand how a slight
shower in the season of ingathering may not always be an evil, but a
very good thing indeed; and only a few such passing, labour-inciting
showers have we known here for a whole month, and <i>that</i> is much
to say when the month is to be counted from mid-September to
mid-October.</p>
<p>And, O gentle reader, we only wish you were with us here to see for
yourself, <i lang="la">propriis oculis</i>, for no pen can describe it,
one or more of the many magnificent sunsets we have had in the course
of this same bypast month of fine weather. The sunsets of the
equinoctial seasons, both vernal and autumnal, are almost always
beautiful, more particularly those of the autumnal equinox; but never
before, we think, have we seen them so startling, gloriously beautiful,
so gorgeously magnificent, as on several occasions lately. A few
evenings ago, as we were busy in our study, a young lady burst in upon
us in a state of great excitement, begging us to throw aside our pen
for a little, and come out to see the exceeding glory of the setting
sun. We readily complied of course, and taking the young lady by the
hand we made a race of it till we reached our &ldquo;coigne of
vantage,&rdquo; a grassy green knoll, a favourite standpoint when any
celestial phenomenon of importance to the W. or S.W. of us is to be
observed. The scene, in truth, was indescribably beautiful, and we
stood in speechless admiration, not unmingled with awe, in sight of the
most glorious sunset our eyes ever beheld. Before us lay the whole
expanse of the Linnhe Loch, shimmering as if gently aboil in a flood of
pale golden light. Beyond, rose what seemed the one vast unbroken range
of the mountains of Ardgour, Kingerloch, and Morven, bathed in a rich
dark purple <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>hue, that for the moment so thoroughly
obliterated every trace of their native ruggedness, that our companion
prettily observed, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you the idea, sir, as I have,
that if one were only near enough these beautiful mountains to pat them
lovingly with the hand, they would feel to the touch soft and warm as a
roll of velvet?&rdquo; a thought, unconsciously perhaps, tinged with
poetry, though the woman pure and simple comes out very unmistakeably
in the reference to the &ldquo;roll of velvet.&rdquo; In the far
background, thirty miles away, rose the glory and pride of Mull
(Blackie&rsquo;s favourite island of all the Hebrides), the huge
mountains of Benmore and Ben-na-Bairnich, their base and middle zones
ink-black, their shoulders dark orange, here and there curiously
streaked with threads of pearly light, their summits and sloping ridges
fringed with living fire. Above, the whole western heavens was full of
vast continents, peninsulas, isthmuses, and islands of cloud, all afire
at their edges, with firths, ferries, and Mediterraneans of liquid gold
between. As the full-orbed sun, fiery and red, slowly sank to the
horizon, the clouds were rent asunder as if by the very excellency of
the glory that beat upon them; some of them assuming fantastic shapes,
in which a lively imagination had no difficulty in tracing striking
resemblances to the hugest animals of our own and past ages, a monster
saurian in sharply defined <i>silhouette</i>, being so marvellously
outlined that our fair companion sketched it on the spot, as a memento
of a sunset that neither of us is likely ever to forget. As the
sun&rsquo;s lower limb seemed just to touch and rest an instant on the
highest peak of the Kingerloch range, a large mass of cloud immediately
above him rapidly assumed a columnar shape, perpendicular to the plane
of the horizon, and, as the splendid orb dipped and disappeared, this
huge &ldquo;pillar of cloud&rdquo; became a perfect Ionic column,
sharply outlined, and admirably correct in all its proportions from
base to entablature, and all aglow with living fire; shaft and pediment
with richest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>crimson; frieze and architrave and cornice with
the glow of molten mettle at &ldquo;white heat&rdquo; as it issues from
a blast furnace. There was, truth to say, something terrible about the
scene, a wild and weird combination of the sublime and beautiful such
as Edmund Burke never beheld even in his dreams. It was impossible, in
the presence of the &ldquo;terrible majesty&rdquo; of that glory, to
avoid thinking of the awfulness that must appertain to a scene of which
all of us shall one day be spectators, when the &ldquo;elements shall
melt with fervent heat,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;earth also, and the works
that are therein,&rdquo; shall be consumed with fire. The succeeding
afterglow of that same evening was singularly beautiful. The mountains
of Appin and Glencoe were for a time bathed from their summits to their
shoulders in the richest purple and gold, making them look so soft and
warm, that for the moment their actual ruggedness was utterly
forgotten, and one felt towards them a far stronger and tenderer
sentiment than mere admiration. And very curiously, as we gazed, did
the night immediately succeed the afterglow, for of twilight there was
none&mdash;there rarely is indeed in autumn, as the old Highlanders
were too observant not to notice, for what saith the old and well-known
rhyme?&mdash;</p>

<p>France has recently lost one of her greatest men by the death of M.
Leverrier, her distinguished astronomer, the most distinguished
astronomer, it is not too much to say, of the present century. Many,
indeed, achieved greater triumphs with the telescope, for with the
telescope Leverrier did comparatively little; it was as a
<i>mathematical</i> astronomer that he was unrivalled. He came first
prominently into notice while still a young man, with his cometary
investigations, and his researches into the motions of the planet
Mercury, constructing tables by which transits of the latter can be
predicted with such absolute correctness that the mean error never
exceeds <i>sixteen seconds</i> of time. But it is with the discovery of
the planet <i>Neptune</i> that Leverrier&rsquo;s name is imperishably
associated. The case briefly stated was this:&mdash;It was found, after
a time, that the planet <i>Uranus</i>, discovered by Sir William
Herschel, did not actually follow the orbit which theory had assigned
to it. It had a mysterious trick of leaving the computed track, and
describing a greater orbit, if the law of gravitation was to hold good,
than the tables founded on that law warranted. Astronomers were puzzled
to account for the vagaries of an orbit that, according to their
theory, ought to be well-behaved, and staid and steady-going as any
other member of the solar system. What could the perturbations of
Uranus mean? was the question asked; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>and at the suggestion
of his friend the distinguished Arago, Leverrier undertook to answer
it, and in due time <i>did</i> answer it in such wise as filled the
world with astonishment and admiration. Resolutely grasping with his
task, Leverrier laboured long and laboured hard to resolve the mystery,
and as a first step with this result, that the problem was utterly
unresolvable on any other conceivable theory or conjecture than that
another planet, albeit unknown to astronomers, and hitherto as
unsuspected as it was unseen, existed <i>exterior</i> to Uranus, and
that it was to the attraction or disturbing influence of this hitherto
undreamt-of orb that the perturbations and mysterious vagaries of
Uranus could alone be ascribed. A memoir stating the conclusion arrived
at, and all the calculations leading towards it, was read before the
Royal Academy of Sciences in June 1846, and the young and daring
astronomer straightway resumed his labours, of which the aim was now to
determine the elements of the orbit of the unknown planet, in the
existence of which he now believed as firmly as in that of the visibly
perturbed orb Uranus itself. The astronomical world shook its head
dubiously, and waited. Did such a planet really exist, and if it did,
could this daring Frenchman find it? M. Leverrier meantime laboured on,
and finally mastering every difficulty, he gave the computed plans of
orbit, the mass and natural position of his constructed world, if in
truth, that is, such a world existed. This was in a second memoir to
the Academy of Sciences on the last day of August 1846. Towards the end
of the following month (September 1846), Leverrier wrote to M. Galle,
of Berlin, requesting him to level the powerful telescope under his
charge at a particular point of the heavens, and there, in effect, said
the wonderful Frenchman, you will find the cause of the perturbations
of Uranus, a new and distant world, hitherto undreamt of and unseen by
mortal eye, but existing all the same. M. Galle, on the first
favourable opportunity, directed his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb377" href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>telescope as
requested, and there, within less than a <i>single degree</i> of its
computed place, and flinging back its light from the enormous distance
of more than three <i>billions</i> of miles, was the planet of
Leverrier&rsquo;s analysis, with a diameter, magnitude, and orbit all
as calculated and predicted. It was a glorious triumph, the most
wonderful achievement in the annals of a science where all is
wonder.</p>
<p>Publicly and privately has this query been put to us&mdash;Is it
unusual to hear a pigeon cooing at midnight, and the owl hooting in
bright noonday? We answer very unhesitatingly that it is unusual, so
unusual in the case of the owl at least, that in a quarter of a
century&rsquo;s familiar and friendly intercourse with our wild-birds
under all possible circumstances, we have never heard an owl hoot
except &ldquo;darkling,&rdquo; as Milton has it, that is, from out the
darkness or sombre shade. Even at night, if the moon is shining bright,
it never hoots from a spot on which the moonbeams fall in full flood;
it selects the deepest shadow even in faint moonlight when uttering its
eerie notes. It will hoot in twilight, and it will hoot when the
heavens are bright ablaze with the most brilliant coruscations of the
aurora, but never, so far as our experience has extended, does it hoot
in honest daylight or even in moonlight, except when, as we have said,
it is itself in deep shade. We have kept pets of all our native species
of owls, and most interesting pets they make, and though, when angry or
in any way out of sorts, it will utter a ready hiss, ending in a
curious rasping guttural, we have never known it to hoot except in the
darkness of night, and, more rarely, in the dim, uncertain light of
evening or morning twilight. The cooing of a pigeon at midnight, while
it may be said to be unusual, is yet a thing that, under certain
circumstances, may be heard at any time. Many birds, captives in cage
or aviary, frequently sing short and incomplete strophes of their
special song in the warm stillness of summer nights, evidently in their
dreams. Others, in their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href=
"#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>natural state of freedom, about
the time of the longest day, when there is hardly any night in our
latitudes, may be heard singing, generally unconnectedly, and in a
faint, uncertain key. The pigeon will coo at any time when brooding, if
rudely disturbed in any way, just as a brooding hen will <i>purr</i>
and scold if you annoy her or her nest at any hour of the day or night.
The cooing of a pigeon, therefore, at midnight is nothing very
wonderful. The hooting of an owl at noonday, however, is surprising,
and a thing which, although we live in a district where owls are
plentiful, is altogether unknown in our experience. <span class=

Winter&mdash;Drowned Hedgehogs: Spines become soft and

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The storms of the latter days of October [November
1877] were exceedingly severe along our western seaboard, and terribly
so, as more than one correspondent assures us, amongst the Hebrides. It
is worth noting with what marvellous punctuality these
Trans-atlantically telegraphed storms reach our shores. They are
&ldquo;up to time,&rdquo; with all the precision almost of our best
appointed mail trains; quite as punctual, at all events, to their
predicted time on several occasions lately as our ocean mail-carrying
steam ships to <i>their</i> appointed dates of arrival. This last
October storm, for example, was telegraphed as being due on our British
shores on or about Saturday, the 27th, and so correct, considering all
the difficulties of such meteorological vaticinations, was the
prediction, that the storm actually reached us here on the evening of
the 26th, increasing in intensity throughout the night and until
mid-day of the 27th, the very day fixed upon, when it blew with all the
force of a hurricane, and the rain fell in torrents, accompanied,
too&mdash;that none of the essentials of a great storm might be
wanting&mdash;by vivid lightning, and thunder peals loud enough to make
the deafest hear, or at all events <i>feel</i>, for it is no
exaggeration to say that the very ground seemed at times to thrill
responsive to the a&euml;rial concussion. The 26th had dawned bright
and clear, and so continued throughout the day; one of those &ldquo;pet
days,&rdquo; in short, not uncommon at this season,&mdash;the sea,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>too, calm and glassy as a mirror. In the
afternoon, however, we were called out from the tea-table to look at a
phenomenon which had already attracted the attention of some of our
more observant neighbours, and about which they wanted our opinion, as
they had some thoughts of going a herring fishing. The phenomenon in
question was this: Not a breath of air was stirring, Loch Linnhe was
unruffled by the slightest zephyr, and yet a heavy surge quite suddenly
began to break along the beach with a sudden boom that was remarkable
in such a calm. A somewhat similar phenomenon, lasting but for a short
time, however, is observed in our lochs when, on a calm summer evening,
one of the Messrs. Hutcheson&rsquo;s paddle steamers&mdash;the
&ldquo;Chevalier,&rdquo; for instance&mdash;passes at full speed close
in shore. What could this swell and surge, troubling a loch otherwise
calm as a mill-pond, mean? You might have safely carried a lighted
candle exposed and lanternless along the beach on which that heavy
swell with hollow boom was breaking&mdash;breaking in great green waves
that showed not a bell or fleck of foam on their crests until they
thundered on the shingle. It was, in a word, a phenomenon for which
there was no apparent adequate cause. The sea, had it been in keeping
with all its visible surroundings, should have been calm and still; on
the contrary, it was restless and perturbed, and there lay the mystery.
Even had we recollected nothing of the telegraphed storm, it was easy
of solution, and our instant interlocutor, as the law courts have it,
was this: &ldquo;A storm in the Atlantic, my good friends. Calm as it
is here, there is a storm, and a wild one, depend upon it, outside
yonder island of Mull, for all it basks so peacefully in the golden
sunset. Nothing else can adequately account for such a swell on our
calm inland waters on an evening so summer-like and warm; and when I
tell you that a storm likely to reach our shores to-morrow has been
telegraphed from America several days since, I conclude that it is that
very storm fast approaching us that causes this swell upon our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>shore. It must be just at hand; so haul up your
boats high and dry; take down your nets from the drying-poles, and put
them in a place of safety. Stay thankfully at home, and let the herring
fishing stand over till the predicted gales have come and gone. Many a
gallant fellow at this moment afloat would be glad to have his foot
like you on <i lang="la">terra firma</i>: <i lang="gd">a chas air
talamh tioram</i> were the words,&mdash;his foot on dry land.&rdquo;
With some such remarks as these, we sent the men home, still wondering,
however; and within a couple of hours the storm was upon us with a loud
prolonged shriek, that showed how thoroughly in earnest it was.
Timeously warned, no danger was done in our district, and we are now
unanimous in speaking with the utmost respect of the Atlantic cable in
connection with storm warnings from the Western Continent. These
telegraphic warnings from America, by the way, of coming storms are of
the utmost importance and value, more particularly to the western
shores of the British Islands. We have no doubt at all that on the
western seaboard of Scotland alone many valuable lives were saved, as
well as much valuable property, by the submarine cable notice that put
us all on our guard with reference to the gale that raged on the 27th
of October, and for several days subsequently. We wonder if from
Britain or the Continent any of the terrible easterly storms of last
winter were telegraphed to America&mdash;timeously and purposely
telegraphed, that is&mdash;so as to be of benefit to our Transatlantic
cousins, as their recent telegrams have been to us. We fear not. But
now at least it is surely a matter of the merest courtesy and cousinly
goodwill that we be prepared and ready to send them betimes telegraphic
messages of all our <i>easterly</i> storms, in return for similar
favours on their part in respect to those that are <i>westerly</i>.</p>
<p>Reading over the foregoing paragraph, which the reader may see was
written <i lang="la">currente calamo</i>&mdash;at a gallop, as it were,
and without a check, as the foxhunter says&mdash;we find that we have
used the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>often-quoted Latin phrase <i lang="la">terra
firma</i>; words which rarely fail to make us smile in their connection
with an anecdote current in St. Andrews in our early college days. It
was to this effect: The driver of a two-horse coach that ran at that
time between St. Andrews and Newport was a George Braid, a respectable
old man, familiarly known to everybody, and notably to the University
students, as &ldquo;Geordie,&rdquo; a liberty with his Christian name
which Mr. Braid in nowise resented, for he was intelligent and shrewd,
and knew that he was thus spoken of and addressed out of goodwill and
kindly regard rather than otherwise. Frequently patronised on his route
by learned professors and lively students, Geordie had picked up many
big words and learned phrases, which he was fond of using in his
family, and, as the Catechism says, amongst his &ldquo;inferiors and
equals.&rdquo; In connection with frequent storm and shipwreck on the
wild east coast, it was the most natural thing in the world that
Geordie should often have heard from the lips of some of his learned
&ldquo;fare&rdquo; the words <i lang="la">terra firma</i>, with which
he associated a general idea of protection, comfort, and safety. One
terrible night of snow and storm, having driven a large coachful from
Newport to the city, Geordie, when he had duly seen to his cattle, and
paid a short visit to the bar of the &ldquo;Cross Keys&rdquo; hostelry,
wended his way by the West Port to his home, which lay beyond the old
city walls. His wife, a brisk and <i>eident</i> bit body, had a roaring
fire and a cheery welcome for her goodman on his entrance, while his
children gathered round him to help him off with caps, coats, leggings,
and all the other belongings of the outer man of a driver in the good
old coaching days. Reduced at last to something like his natural
dimensions, Geordie, having sufficiently rubbed his purple hands before
the fire, looked benignantly around and exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah! Meg, my
woman, you and the bairns hae muckle cause to be thankful to your Maker
that ye hae <i>terra firma abune your heads</i> this night! Its just
awfu&rsquo; out yonder by the Guard <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>Brig and
Strathtyrum.&rdquo; We have met with not a few in our day with a
strange craze for using words and phrases of which they evidently knew
as little of the real meaning and proper application as honest Geordie
Braid with his <i lang="la">terra firma</i>.</p>
<p>The new moon of the 5th, aided by a wind that at times almost
amounted to a gale, gave us along the western seaboard three very high
tides in succession; that of the afternoon of the 6th, however, being
the highest. The naturalist who is fairly diligent on such occasions is
pretty sure to meet with more or less interesting matter for thoughtful
study; nor, so far as our own experience extends, need the entries in
one&rsquo;s note-book, even for what is called the &ldquo;dead&rdquo;
season of mid-winter, be fewer in number, or less interesting or
instructive than those of the pages devoted to the summer season
itself. We have known naturalists whose note-books presented little but
a dreary succession of blank pages for the winter half-year, and who
thought it odd that we should be surprised at it. It has been said that
the laws of disease are as beautiful as those of health, and that peace
has its victories as well as war, and we have no hesitation in saying
that to the true naturalist the winter season, if fairly and diligently
encountered, is in its way just as interesting as the summer, and that
the observer who has all his wits about him, and who goes to work with
a will, may have <i>his</i> &ldquo;victories&rdquo; even in the season
of the winter solstice&mdash;victories as important in their way and
gratifying as are those of midsummer itself, when the days are at their
longest, when summer seas are calm and summer woods are green. In the
course of half an hour&rsquo;s ramble on the beach the other day, we
fell in with some curious waifs, each of which might be made the text
of an interesting monograph. Three drowned hedgehogs, for example, was
a somewhat startling &ldquo;find&rdquo; to turn up in a swathe of
seaware that the advancing tide was slowly rolling up the shingle. One
was full-grown, a female; the other two, both males, were but half or
three parts grown. What <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href=
"#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>brought them there? was the
natural question; for a hedgehog, dead or living, on the sea-shore
under high-water mark, is as odd and out-of-place an object as would be
a mackerel far up the hills amongst the heather. The following is
probably a satisfactory enough explanation of the
mystery:&mdash;Hedgehogs, which twenty years ago were quite unknown in
Lochaber, are now plentiful. A pair, captured on Lord Abinger&rsquo;s
lands at Torlundy, were sent to us some dozen or fifteen years ago as a
great curiosity; and in this district then they were a curiosity, so
much so, that we can recollect that during the time they remained in
our possession as exceedingly tame and most interesting pets, people
from all parts of the country used to come in order to have a close
look at the black-snouted, spine-armoured hedge pigs, as Shakespeare
calls them, the <i lang="gd">graineag</i> or <i>repulsive</i> one of
the midland Highlanders of Athole and Strathspey, where the animal has
always been plentiful. They have now become so common in this district
that a hedgehog is no more accounted a rarity than is a stoat or a
weasel. Hedgehogs are fond of making their cozy nests of moss, grass
fibres, and fallen leaves, near the roots of trees and bushes growing
on the banks of rivers and mountain streams. These last have of late
been frequently swollen beyond their usual bounds by the heavy rains;
and in a spate of this kind poor Mrs. Hedgehog and her youngsters were
caught napping, and carried away by the torrent to the sea, and
ultimately cast ashore by the wind and waves, where we found them in
their winding-sheet of slimy sea-wrack, and for a moment wondered how
it came to pass that they lay there, like poor Ophelia,
&ldquo;drown&rsquo;d, drown&rsquo;d.&rdquo; One remarkable circumstance
connected with these drowned hedgehogs was this: we found to our
surprise that we could handle them with impunity; their spines, so
formidable in the living animal, being quite soft and gelatinous to
their very tips. This is by no means the case with the spines of such
hedgehogs as are killed by trap, or otherwise <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>on
land. In this latter case the spines retain their point and
prickliness, as in the living animal, till in the process of decay they
separate from their sockets in the skin, and drop in brittle, broken
fragments to the ground. A question, then, for future investigation is
this,&mdash;Do the spines of <i>all</i> drowned hedgehogs lose their
prickliness and point, and become soft and gelatinous? If so, has fresh
water alone this effect, or is it necessary that the animal should be
some time immersed in salt water?</p>
<p>Within a short distance of the drowned hedgehogs, lay a large angler
or fishing-frog, the <i lang="la">Lophius piscatorius</i> of
ichthyologists, and a frequent waif on our shores after a gale. It had
evidently been caught by the storm in shallow water, and been beaten to
death by the weight and force of the waves, for it was in excellent
condition, and there was nothing to indicate death in any other way.
Why in this fish such a huge head, with its formidable array of
recurved teeth, and such a cavernous, capacious gullet, should be
joined to a body comparatively so diminutive, is a puzzle that has
never yet been satisfactorily solved; nor can we ourselves, up to this
present moment, advance even a plausible conjecture in explanation of
an anomaly that must have attracted the attention of thousands. The
disproportion between the immense head and the small and slender body
is as great as if you erected a porch lofty and wide enough to serve as
the main entrance to a cathedral, and vestibule to correspond, in order
to enter a dwelling consisting after all but of a single bedroom. Or,
to put it in another way, it is as if you built a large mill, with the
most powerful machinery possible, in order to grind sufficient meal for
the daily consumption of a single dyspeptic customer. <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e8320" title="Source: The-fishing frog">The
fishing-frog</span>, has, we believe, been of late successfully
introduced into more than one of our many aquaria, but we are not aware
that any satisfactory explanation of the difficulty which we are
considering has as yet been arrived at. A full and sufficient
explanation, however, you may be sure <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb386" href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>there must be, if we
only know enough of the animal&rsquo;s economy to get at it.</p>
<p>But we must stop; for hark! an itinerant fiddler has this moment
struck up &ldquo;Bob of Fettercairn&rdquo; just in front of our study
window. He plays admirably too, lovingly caressing the polished base of
his instrument&mdash;his bread-winner, poor fellow&mdash;with his wan
and withered cheek, and wielding a powerful, yet light and delicate,
bow-hand; and we must go and have a crack with him. Nor must you sneer
at us for so doing, gracious reader. The arrival even of a peripatetic,
out-at-elbows fiddler is an event of some importance in such a place as
this on a cold, grey November afternoon. We shall order him a big bowl
of tea, with something to eat, satisfied that if in so doing we are not
entertaining an angel unawares (though there is no reason that we know
of why an angel should <i>not</i> appear in peripatetic fiddler guise,
as well as in any other form), we are at all events entertaining one
who by his appearance manifestly needs something warm and comfortable,
and a little rest by a cheerful fireside at this season, not forgetting
the while that he is a capital fiddler&mdash;of some intelligence, too,
and full of capital stories we warrant him. Depend upon it that Homer,
who was after all but an inspired <i>gaberlunzie</i>, has many a time
and oft appeared in quite as sorry a plight, and with as little
externally to recommend him as this same itinerant fiddler; and think
how proud and glad you and we should be to have a chance of
entertaining the blind old Chian, wandering ballad-singer as he was!
You must, therefore, let us have our way with this poor old man, who,
by the way, in not blind, but, on the contrary, has a good large dark
brown eye of his own, so common, we have noticed, in people musically
inclined, that it may be called the musical eye; and if he is all we
take him for, and he and we got on well together, you may perhaps hear
of him again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Favoured by the most splendid Christmas weather
[January 1878], piercingly cold, indeed, but beautifully bright and
clear, a run from Lochaber to Clydesdale on an agreeable errand is
exceedingly enjoyable. Our first day in Glasgow was devoted to the
Kelvin Grove Museum, which we had now an opportunity, for the first
time, of examining thoroughly and at leisure, and with which, as the
reader may believe, we were very much delighted. On handing our card to
Mr. Paton, the curator, we were received by himself and his assistant,
Mr. Campbell&mdash;the latter, of course, a Highlander&mdash;in the
friendliest manner; and a couple of hours were very pleasantly and
profitably spent in examining a really curious and valuable collection,
so admirably catalogued and arranged, that we believe we saw and
minutely studied everything to be seen as leisurely and satisfactorily
as was possible in the time at our disposal. Our friend Mr. Snowie, of
Inverness, had written us before leaving home that he was sending some
contributions to the museum, of which he begged us to undertake the
formal delivery, and see properly placed; and this of course we had
much pleasure in doing. These contributions are a valuable acquisition
to the museum, and are as follows:&mdash;(1.) Hoopoe (<i lang=
"la">Upupa epops</i>, Linn.), a female, in fine plumage, and admirably
set up. This bird was captured by the boys at the Inverness Reformatory
School, and dying, notwithstanding it received all the attention and
kindly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>care that could be bestowed upon it, it passed
into Mr. Snowie&rsquo;s hands. (2.) Wild cat, stuffed, an excellent
specimen, with very prominent markings, trapped at Fasnakyle, on The
Chisholm&rsquo;s estate. (3.) A <i>white</i> blackbird, and an albino
bunting, both shot by Mr. T. B. Snowie near Inverness. (4.) Snipe and
other marsh-bird skins, shot by the same. (5.) Two small hares
preserved in a bottle; taken out of an unusually large-sized female
shot at Dochfour in September 1875; a very interesting preparation.
(6.) Head of otter, trapped on the River Peffer in 1876. (7.) Owl
(<i lang="la">Strix flammea</i>, Linn.), shot in October 1877 by Mr. T.
B. Snowie. (8.) Egg of golden eagle; this last, perhaps, the most
welcome gift of all, as eagles&rsquo; eggs are now become so rare as
readily to command prices ranging from &pound;5 to &pound;10 each.
Attached to the museum proper there is a fresh-water aquarium. In one
of the tanks, in which several fine pike are &ldquo;interned,&rdquo; we
noticed that one of the largest, who advanced to the front of the tank,
in order to examine as closely as possible a slip of paper which we
were trailing along the glass by way of bait, had his muzzle, more
particularly the anterior part of the upper jaw, seriously disfigured
by a fungoid growth of jelly-like appearance; and calling the
curator&rsquo;s attention to the fact, we made the remark that the poor
pike seemed too seriously diseased to live long. We were surprised when
told that the fish was none the worse for his fungoid moustache; that
it had been long in that way, and that all that was needed was an
occasional cleansing of the muzzle, as you would wipe away a clot of
jelly that had accidentally fallen on your knife-handle at dessert, and
the fish then seemed all right enough until it grew again to such a
size as to be an inconvenience.</p>
<p>Leaving the museum, we had but barely sufficient time for dress and
dinner before proceeding to take the chair at the Gathering of the
Clans in the City Hall, and a very splendid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>and
enthusiastic gathering it was. From floor to ceiling the huge building
was crammed, and as we took our seat and bowed in acknowledgment of the
truly Highland welcome that greeted us in the shape of round upon round
of loud and lusty cheers, we could not help feeling a little nervous
and out of sorts in realising the fact that we were for the moment
&ldquo;the observed of all observers,&rdquo; and, by the kind
partiality of the Highlanders of Glasgow, made to occupy a position of
which any one might well be proud. We were soon at our ease, however,
and found no difficulty in discharging our duties in connection with a
meeting which was from first to last, and in all its belongings, a
great success. The dancing was excellent; the singing could hardly have
been better; while the pipe music was of itself well worth going a much
longer distance to hear than that which separates Nether Lochaber from
the City Hall of Glasgow. No other living man, perhaps, can play reels
and strathspeys as Donald Macphee can play them; and we do not think we
ever heard anything more admirably played than was Malcolm
Macpherson&rsquo;s <i>port m&ograve;r</i> or <i lang=
"gd">piobaireachd</i> proper, <i lang="gd">Fhuair mi p&ograve;g&rsquo;s
laimh mo righ</i>, composed at Holyrood in 1745 by <i lang="gd">Ewen
Macdhomhnuil Bhuidhe</i>, a Macmillan from Glendessary and piper to
Lochiel, on seeing his chief kiss Charles Edward&rsquo;s hand at a
levee held in the palace of his ancestors by that Prince a day or two
after the victory at Gladsmuir. Macpherson played this <i lang=
"gd">piobaireachd</i> so exquisitely that some of us felt our eyes grow
moist, and were in no wise ashamed of it, long ere he had reached the
difficult but beautifully managed fingering of the concluding
<i>urlar</i>. We have always had a warm regard for James Boswell,
Johnson&rsquo;s biographer, for this amongst other reasons, that, on
his own confession, music frequently affected <i>him</i> as it affected
many of us on this occasion. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; growled Johnson,
&ldquo;I should never hear it if it made me such a fool.&rdquo; But
then a man, however great, cannot be everything; and Johnson was not
only not a Scotchman, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href=
"#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>but the very antipodes of a
Scotchman&mdash;he was an Englishman, proud and prejudiced, and deaf
and dead as a stone to the charms of music, whether vocal or
instrumental. When at Sleat, in Skye, many years afterwards, he made
the confession that &ldquo;he knew a drum from a trumpet, and a bagpipe
from a guitar, which was about the extent of his knowledge of
music.&rdquo; We parted with our friends of the Highland Association on
the best terms; they were good-natured enough to say that they were
pleased with us; we certainly had every reason to be pleased with
<i>them</i>.</p>
<p>We were astir betimes next morning, in order to fulfil an engagement
undertaken at the request of some naturalist friends in London&mdash;a
visit, namely, to the Aquarium at Rothesay, an admirably conducted
institution, one of the best in the kingdom. We expected to see a great
deal that could not well fail to interest us, and we <i>did</i> see a
great deal that pleased us very much indeed; the best proof of which is
that after several hours&rsquo; wandering from tank to tank, it was
with a sigh of regret that our attention was called to the fact that it
was already time for us to put up our note-book and find our way as
quickly as possible to the pier, if we would overtake the
<i>Mountaineer</i> for Greenock, in order to reach Glasgow again that
evening. Of all the tanks, that which we lingered longest before,
perhaps, was that set apart for sea anemones, of which the collection
is exceedingly curious and interesting. All the specimens seemed
perfectly healthy and well-to-do, though, owing to the fact that the
afternoon had now become wet and dull, they were disinclined to display
their beauties in full. In another of the tanks, of which the most
distinguished inhabitant is a conger eel of a large size, we were much
amused with the conduct of a seven or eight pound cod, that seemed as
if he would willingly have spoken to us if he could. As soon as he
became aware of our presence, he came sailing out of a dark recess
behind a rocky promontory&mdash;a sort of Mull of Kintyre in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>miniature&mdash;which is his usual <i>howf</i>,
and advancing straight to the front of the tank, put his nose to the
glass, wagging his tail, and staring at us with an expression of
countenance so queer and comical, that it made us laugh outright.
&ldquo;Well, Nether Lochaber, my boy,&rdquo; he seemed inclined to say,
&ldquo;how are you? This is all very fine, but on the word of a cod,
believe me that I&rsquo;d far rather be cruising about the shores and
shallows of Loch Linnhe, down yonder in your own neighbourhood, than be
confined here from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end, to be stared
at by a lot of people who may pretend some interest in me from a purely
scientific point of view, but who, between ourselves, if the truth were
known, never see me but they straightway think of how I should be
boiled and served with sauce. Only the other day, for instance, a lady
visitor from Glasgow asked one of the attendants what he thought might
be my weight, and if he was of opinion that a cod out of an aquarium
tank would be quite as good eating as one direct from the sea? When I
hear talk of that kind, it hurts my feelings, I can tell you.&rdquo;
All this, and a great deal more, we fancied the cod would have said if
he could; and as we tapped the glass at his nose and bade him a
friendly good-bye, we almost persuaded ourselves that he responded with
a knowing wink, as with a single sweep of his tail he put about and
joined the conger in a brisk constitutional round and athwart the
tank&mdash;a tank so crystal clear, and clean and comfortable, as
indeed are all the tanks, that the inmates, abundantly and regularly
fed, ought to be happy enough, were it not that, like Sterne&rsquo;s
starling, they probably find the great drawback on their happiness in
the fact that after all they are prisoners, that they can&rsquo;t get
out. We were much delighted with the seal-house and its lively and
intelligent occupants. The shape of a seal&rsquo;s head is sufficient
to convince the most careless observer that it must contain a great
deal of brains; while its full and lively eye bespeaks a high and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>active order of intelligence. Those at present
in the Rothesay Aquarium, three in number, are most interesting
animals, and almost as tame as lapdogs. It so happened that we entered
their house at a time when they were exceedingly active and lively, for
they were well aware that a large basket, which had just been carried
to the side of their tank, contained fresh fish of some kind or other
for their dinner; and they raced and leaped about in eager expectation
of the treat, for they were evidently hungry&mdash;always a good sign
of an aquarium inmate. The fish consisted of small flounders; and the
agility and graceful ease of the motions of these seals, as they dived
and dashed after a fish, which, while they were begging dog-like before
us at one end of the tank, we suddenly tossed to the other end, was so
admirable that we continued a long time to play at a sort of
pitch-and-toss game that was quite as agreeable to them as it could
possibly be interesting to us. We only ceased our part of the
performance when we thought that for the time they must have had
enough, the seal being probably as liable to indigestion as the result
of a surfeit as is any other animal. When, however, they found that
they had nothing more to expect from us, they showed their intelligence
and <i lang="fr">nous</i> by at once commencing to climb out of their
tank, at the very spot, too, where it was easiest of accomplishment, on
the side on which they knew the fish-basket was placed. What could they
now be after? was the question we asked ourselves. One after another
they got out and waddled along the pavement, awkwardly indeed, but as
quickly as they could, past us, keeping their big and beautiful eyes
steadily fixed on ours, till they reached the basket, and in a moment
each had seized a fish, with which he instantly tumbled heels-over-head
into the tank again at the point nearest him, evidently afraid that we
might try and intercept him, and deprive him of a <i lang="fr">bonne
bouche</i>, which all of them seemed perfectly well somehow to
understand they had no right to take in such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>reiving fashion. We noticed that when we threw a
fish into the tank, and one of them got hold of it, the other two
endeavoured to snatch it from him, and for the moment there was a wild
tumult and tumble, in which the water was lashed into foam. In this,
however, as far as we could judge, there was no manifestation of
anything like anger, or the slightest attempt to hurt or injure each
other. It was more like the rough and tumble play of children after a
ball, or something of that sort, which all may strongly desire to
possess, but which only one can have for the moment. <span class=

<p class="first">With all their tendency, in their every reference to
the past, to become <i lang="la">laudatores temporis acti</i>, the
sturdy upholders of the superiority of all that <i>was</i>, in
comparison with anything and everything that <i>is</i>, our
weather-wise octogenarian friends here are all agreed that so
summer-like a February [1878] month they never knew before. It is true
that in making this admission they shake their heads sapiently, and
hint that no good can come of such an unnatural commingling of the
times and seasons. It will be well, they add, if before cuckoo day
(<i lang="gd">mun d&rsquo;thig latha na cuaig</i>) we haven&rsquo;t to
pay for it all in the shape of storm and cold at a time when these are
as unseasonable and out of place as is summer calm and summer sunshine
<i>now</i>. It was amusing to see these honest old croakers selecting
the coziest nooks <i lang="gd">air ch&ugrave;l gaoithe&rsquo;s air
aodain gr&eacute;ine</i>, as the Fingalian tale has it,&mdash;that is,
at the back of the wind and in the face of the sun&mdash;and thoroughly
enjoying the calm and sunshine at the very moment that they would
impress upon us the unnaturalness and unseasonableness of it all. The
first fortnight of February was, indeed, wonderfully fine; from the
beginning of the month up to the evening of St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day,
more like the close of April or early May than anything usually looked
for while the sun is still in <i>Aquarius</i>. Driving overland to Oban
on the 11th, and, by the ferries of Ballachulish, Shian, and Connel, a
very beautiful drive it is, hardly to be equalled elsewhere even in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>the West Highlands; the day was so bright, and
calm, and clear, that while mavis and merle, and hedge-accenter and
chaffinch greeted us from copse and hedgerow with their rich and mellow
song, the driver, sitting beside us, couldn&rsquo;t help observing as
we passed by Appin House, &ldquo;Na &rsquo;n robh chuag again a nis,
bha &rsquo;n samhradh fhein ann!&rdquo; &ldquo;If we had but the cuckoo
now, it would be summer its very self!&rdquo; On the beach, a little
above high-water mark, just under Appin House, and within an easy
stone&rsquo;s cast of the public road, there is an immense spherical
boulder of granite, to which there is attached a curious old story,
which invests with additional interest an object deserving enough of
attention for its own sake&mdash;for the sake, that is, of its huge
size and almost perfect spherical form, this latter peculiarity, in the
huge solid mass, making it the most remarkable thing of the kind on the
mainland, at least of the West Highlands. The story of the Appin House
boulder, or <i lang="gd">Clach Ruric</i> as it is called, is, dropping
minor and unessential details, to the following effect:&mdash;Long,
long ago a Prince of Lochlin or Scandinavia, with a formidable fleet of
war galleys, made a descent upon the Hebrides, killing and plundering
everywhere with a ruthlessness known only, even in those days of rude
lawlessness, to the Vikings of the north. Having thoroughly devastated
the islands, Ruric&mdash;for such was the Prince&rsquo;s
name&mdash;steered for the mainland of Morven, and took up his
residence in the castle of Mearnaig, in Glensanda. In this stronghold,
the ruins of which still exist, he resolved to pass the winter, with
the intention of over-running and plundering the adjoining districts in
the spring, and afterwards sailing homewards in the calm of summer
seas, for his galleys were so deeply laden with booty that he feared to
encounter the turbulence of the North Sea at any other season. In the
early spring the cruel Northman was betimes astir, killing and
plundering with but little opposition throughout the districts of
Kingerloch, Sunart, and Ardgour, to the head of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>Lochiel. While of his numerous fleet a single
galley showed more than a foot and a span (<i lang="gd">troidh agus
r&egrave;is</i> were the words of the narrator) of gunwale unsubmerged,
Ruric was unsatisfied, and to complete his ill-gotten freight he
resolved on the plunder of the opposite district of Appin, the smoke of
whose dwellings could be seen, and the lowing of whose numerous herds
could be heard (when the summer morning was still and the Linnhe Loch
was calm) by the pirate prince from the battlements of the castle of
Mearnaig. One morning Ruric anchored his galleys in the Sound of Shuna,
and landing, erected his tents on the green knoll now occupied by Appin
House. With this spot as his head-quarters, it was his intention to
plunder the district north and south of him at his leisure, believing
that he would meet with as little opposition here as he had already met
with elsewhere. The inhabitants of Appin, however, were partly on their
guard, and determined to resist, and if possible chastise, the invader.
And first conveying their old men, women, and children, with their
flocks and herds, into the fastnesses of the upland glens, they
resolved to watch the movements of the Norsemen, ready to fall upon
them whenever a favourable opportunity should offer. That same night,
as some cattle herds, acting as scouts, were on the hill immediately
above the tents of the invaders, one of them directed the attention of
his companions to a huge granite boulder with so slight a hold of the
hill crest, that, with some little labour, it might be let loose at any
time&mdash;a terrible messenger of wrath&mdash;amongst the tents of the
enemy below, whose shouts of laughter at that moment, and snatches of
rude song, proved that they had feasted plentifully and had no
<span class="corr" id="xd26e8453" title=
"Source: apprehenson">apprehension</span> of immediate death or danger
in any form. After much labour, the herdsmen managed so to dig about
and undermine and loosen the boulder in its bed on the hill-face, that,
on a given signal, their united strength sufficed to tilt it headlong
over the steep, leaping and thundering on its terrible path. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>largest trees in its course snapped before the
boulder like reeds: when it came into momentary contact with a rock,
the sparks flew heavenward as if from an exploded meteor! In a dozen of
bounds it reached the tents of the Norsemen, crushing, mangling,
grinding into pulp or powder (<i lang="gd">a pronnadh agus a
bruanadh</i>, are the Gaelic words) everything it touched, and finally
stopping where it now stands, to be long regarded by the people of the
district with a feeling akin to superstitious awe, and to be known by
the name of <i lang="gd">Clach Ruric</i>. In the morning, the Norsemen
could only know by the mangled fragments of their bodies that their
Prince, with his two sons, and many of those next to him in power, had
met with a terrible death. Before the Appin men could gather in
sufficient force to attack them, the Norsemen unmoored their galleys,
chanting the death-song of their chief as they unmoored, and set sail
for Lochlin, never more to trouble the mainland of the West Highlands
with their invasions. The venerable <i lang="gd">seanachie</i> from
whom we picked up this tradition, added that Castle <i>C&oelig;fin</i>,
or Cyffin, in Lismore, is so called after a Danish prince of that name,
who also was connected with Ruric&rsquo;s expedition, though in what
manner he was unable to say.</p>
<p>Not far from Clach Ruric, on an island rock in the entrance to the
Sound of Shuna, are the ruins of another castle, of a later date,
however, and more recent interest than can be attached to the many
strongholds of the Viking period perched on the rocks and promontories
of this part of the West Highlands. This is Castle Stalker, or, in the
language of the district itself, <i>Caisteal-an-Stalcaire</i>, the
Castle of the Falconer or Fowler. The small rock-island on which it is
built is <i>Sgeir-an-Sgairbh</i> (the sea-rock, or skerry of the
cormorant), from very early times the gathering cry at once and
<span class="corr" id="xd26e8478" title=
"Source: rendevous">rendezvous</span> of the Stewarts of Appin in all
their maritime expeditions. Castle Stalker dates from about the
beginning of the reign of James IV., for whose convenience and
accommodation, when, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398"
name="pb398">398</a>]</span>as frequently happened, he extended his
hunting expeditions to this district, it was built. Stewart of Appin,
who was a great favourite with the king, was appointed hereditary
keeper, and the castle continued in the possession of the family until,
about the year 1645, the Mac Ian Stewart of that date, in a moment of
drunken folly, made it over to his wily neighbour, Donald Campbell of
the Airds, receiving in return the handsome and adequate equivalent of
an eight-oared <i>birlinn</i>, or small wherry! Stewart, when sober,
would have gladly cancelled so manifestly one-sided a barter-bargain at
any sacrifice, but Campbell, having got possession, kept it; while the
disgraceful transaction so stung the pride of the Stewarts that they
practically deposed the <i>Baothaire</i> (the silly one), as they
nicknamed the chief, from his chieftainship, by unanimously electing
his cousins of Invernahyle and Ardsheal to be their leaders in the
subsequent wars of Montrose. For a short time during Montrose&rsquo;s
ascendancy in the Highlands, and for a longer period towards the close
of the reign of Charles II., Castle Stalker was again in the possession
of the Stewarts; but at the Revolution the Campbells had it all their
own way; they repossessed themselves of the castle, and it has remained
theirs ever since. About forty years ago a gentleman of the family of
<i lang="gd">Ailein &rsquo;Ic Rob</i> of Appin, who had amassed a
considerable fortune in the West Indies, offered the then proprietor a
large sum for the bare rock and ruins of Castle Stalker, but the offer
was refused.</p>
<p>From the wooded knoll to the left, as we entered the village of
Portnacroish, we heard some notes that, harsh as they were, delighted
us, for we had not heard them for many years; and the reader will
perhaps smile when we confess delight in association with what was
neither more nor less than the chattering of a pair of magpies! Knowing
that it must be magpie chattering and nothing else, though the lively
confabulators were for the moment invisible, we got out of our
conveyance, and on reaching <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href=
"#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>an open glade we got sight of a
pair of these beautiful birds perched on the topmost bough of an old
ash tree; and so busy were they in the discussion of what must have
been a matter of grave and immediate importance, that the usually shy
and wary birds did not notice our approach till we were quite close
upon them, when, with a scream of alarm and an indignant flirt of their
tails, they glided in graceful curve, rather than flew, over the tree
tops and disappeared. So rare has the magpie become in Lochaber and the
immediately surrounding districts, that a sight of a pair of these
handsome and sagacious birds delighted us exceedingly. We had little
difficulty in concluding that their lively chattering on that bright
and beautiful morning was about no less important a matter than the
propriety of at once putting their house in order and setting about the
labours of incubation. If there were any truth in popular superstition,
that particular day ought to have afterwards turned out a disagreeable
one to us; for had we not seen <i>two</i> magpies together, and what is
more, did we not go out of our way to see them, when we might have
easily passed on unseen of them, as they were invisible to us? In the
south of Scotland the old pyet rhyme is something like this&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;One&rsquo;s joy,</p>
<p class="line">Two&rsquo;s grief,</p>
<p class="line">Three a wedding,</p>
<p class="line">Four death.<span class="corr" id="xd26e8509" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the old <i lang="gd">sgeulachd</i> the Gaelic rhyme
is of similar import&mdash;</p>
<div lang="gd" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Chunnaic mi pioghaid a&rsquo;s dh-&eacute;irich
leam;</p>
<p class="line">Chunnaic mi dh&agrave; &rsquo;sgum b&rsquo;iargain
iad;</p>
<p class="line">Chunnaic mi tri a&rsquo;s b&rsquo;aighearach mi;</p>
<p class="line">Ach ceithir ri&rsquo;m linn chan iarrainn
iad.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In our own case, on that particular occasion, the
superstition could not have been more completely falsified by the
event, for, maugre the magpies, our trip to Oban was in its every
circumstance as agreeable and pleasant as it could well be. What a pity
it is that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>these beautiful birds, whose favourite
residence, too, if they were only permitted to live in peace, is the
immediate vicinity of human dwellings, should be of such evil repute
that gamekeepers everywhere consider themselves justified in
accomplishing their utter destruction by every means in their power.
Their <i>utter</i> destruction we have said; and it is only as to their
total extirpation that we would venture on a word of expostulation with
gamekeepers and their employers. It is true that the magpie is an enemy
to winged game, being a cunning and persistent nest-robber, an adroiter
sucker of eggs than the proverbial &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo; herself.
That the gamekeeper should therefore dislike them is the most natural
thing in the world, and that, in gamekeeper&rsquo;s own phrase, they
should &ldquo;be kept down&rdquo; is proper enough. But we cannot agree
that it is necessary that the bird should be utterly destroyed. Here
and there on a wide estate an occasional pair of magpies might surely
be tolerated for the sake of their beauty and amusingly lively manners,
and on the divine principle of &ldquo;live and let live.&rdquo; For our
own part, in approaching a gentleman&rsquo;s residence, the sight of a
pair of these birds flitting about &ldquo;the old ancestral elms&rdquo;
always intensifies our respect for the place and the owner.</p>
<p>Crossing Loch Creran, by the Ferry of Shian, we are in
Benderloch&mdash;classic ground, and arch&aelig;ologically the most
interesting spot, perhaps, in all the West Highlands. &ldquo;Everything
here is beautiful,&rdquo; says Dr. Macculloch. &ldquo;The distance
between the ferries of Shian and Connel is but five miles; but it is a
day&rsquo;s journey for a wise man.&rdquo; About half-way is
<i>D&ugrave;n-Mac-Uisneachain</i> (the Fort of the Son of
<i>Uisneach</i>), one of the most interesting of our vitrified forts,
<i>qu&acirc;</i> such, and supposed to be the Beregonium of Hector
Boethius, and the site of the still older Selma, the &ldquo;Hall of
Swords&rdquo; of Ossianic song. That it was a place of importance long
before the time of the Dalriad Scots seems very certain; and, leaving
Macpherson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ossian&rdquo; altogether out of the question,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>there occur in the old Fingalian ballads, and
tales of the F&eacute;inne, about the antiquity of which there has
never been dispute; numberless local references which seem in a very
remarkable manner to point to this spot as the principal stronghold in
Scotland (for they were of Ireland also) of the Fingalians at one
period, and that the most important, perhaps, in their history. Within
a short distance of Dun-Mac-Uisneachain, and commanding it, is a steep,
rocky eminence of considerable height, called Dunvallary or
Dunvallanry, the etymology of which may be <i lang=
"gd">D&ugrave;n-bhail&rsquo;-n-righ</i>, the Fortified Place of the
King&rsquo;s Town; or <i lang="gd">D&ugrave;n-bhail&rsquo; n
&rsquo;fhr&igrave;th</i>, the Fort of the Town on the verge of the
Hunting Forest. Stretching away towards Connel and Loch Etive is the
wide moorland flat of Achnacree, which, with its numerous cairns,
Druidical circles, monoliths, and other relics of the olden time, may
very well be the ancient &ldquo;plains of Lora;&rdquo; Lora itself,
frequently mentioned in Ossianic poetry, and meaning <i>Luath
shruth</i>, the loud, swift current, <i>par excellence</i>, meeting us
face to face, so to speak, in the turbulently impetuous rapids of
Connel. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=

<p class="first">A finer February month from first to last was never
known in the West Highlands. With an amount of sunshine that April
might be glad of, it was mild and open throughout; the sort of weather,
in short, that Thomson must have been dreaming about, when he invoked
the season of bursting bud and wildflower as &ldquo;Gentle Spring,
ethereal mildness.&rdquo; March [1878], too, has come in, not
lion-like, as the meteorological proverb would have it, but &ldquo;like
a lamb,&rdquo; as it is hoped it may continue and end. Everybody is now
astir, and &ldquo;speed the plough&rdquo; is the order of the day, as
well, indeed, it may, for the bud has already opened into leaf, and
primroses are plentiful&mdash;so plentiful that they may be gathered in
handfuls from the hazel copse and woodland glade. As for our wild-bird
friends, they are in ecstasies with it all, everywhere in full and
fluent song, and making love with an ardour and directness of purpose
that rarely fails of its reward. Nest-building, the most important and
serious labour of their lives, but a labour of love all the same, is
being rapidly proceeded with, the God-taught architects knowing not
only to labour, but <i>how best</i> to labour, frequently resting a
space to refresh themselves with song:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p>And while speaking of birds, this is, perhaps, the proper place to
refer to a paragraph that appeared recently:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">The Lilac Tree and
Birds.</span>&mdash;Burns has a song, &lsquo;Oh, were my love yon lilac
fair,&rsquo; &amp;c. Cunningham has remarked that Burns had made an
unhappy selection of a tree for sheltering his little bird; for the
feathered songsters are found to avoid the lilac when in flower, owing
to its peculiar smell. We confess we are not skilled enough in natural
history to attest the accuracy of Cunningham&rsquo;s
assertion.&rdquo;&mdash;Paterson&rsquo;s <i>Burns</i>, vol. iii.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fully to appreciate Cunningham&rsquo;s objection, it is proper that
we quote the song in full; but before doing so, it may be observed that
it is founded on an older version, of which the best lines are
retained, as is the case with not a few of Burns&rsquo; finest
love-songs. Writing to George Thomson in the summer of 1793, the poet
says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the following beautiful little fragment in
Witherspoon&rsquo;s <i>Collection of Scots Songs</i>?&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Oh, gin my love were yon red
rose,</p>
<p class="line">That grows upon the castle wa.&rsquo;<span class="corr"

</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;This thought is inexpressibly beautiful, and
quite, so far as I know, original. It is too short for a song, else I
would forswear you altogether, unless you give it a place. I have often
tried to make a stanza to it, but in vain. After balancing myself for a
musing five minutes on the hind legs of my elbow-chair, I produced the
following. The verses are far inferior to the original, I frankly
confess; but if worthy of insertion at all, they might be first in
place; as every poet who knows anything of his trade will husband his

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Cunningham&rsquo;s ornithological objection to the
song we believe to be well founded; and it is not a little to his
credit, as proving what a close and clear observer of the habits of our
song-birds he must have been, that he was the first, so far as we know,
to notice, how reluctant they are to have anything to do with the lilac
while in flower, though at other seasons they perch upon it as freely
as upon other shrubs. We are not as sure, however, that our song-birds
object to the lilac because of anything disagreeable to them in the
perfume of its flowers. Except in the case of some of the
<i>Raptores</i>, birds as a rule are neither acute nor delicate of
smell, our little song-birds least of all perhaps. We rather think the
reason of their dislike to it is to be found, partly at least, if not
wholly, in the fact that while it is in flower, its bark, particularly
along the smaller branches and twigs, is covered with a slimy secretion
or exudation at once viscid and acrid; and if there is one thing more
than another which our wild-birds unanimously and with all their hearts
detest, it is to have their legs or toes come in contact with anything
glutinous or &ldquo;sticky.&rdquo; Every bird-fancier knows how
uncomfortable and generally miserable is a bird just upon being taken
off a limed twig; not, observe, because he is a captive&mdash;thoughts
of <i>that</i> may trouble him afterwards&mdash;but immediately and in
the first instance because of the bird-lime about his toes.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>The first thing, therefore, that the
bird-catcher does is to cleanse the captive&rsquo;s feet and toes by
rubbing them gently between his finger and thumb with fine sand, and
afterwards washing them with water; an operation no sooner performed
and the bird restored to its cage, than it evinces its satisfaction at
being relieved from its state of intolerable discomfort in many little
ways that cannot well escape the notice of even the most unobservant.
We have known a newly captured chaffinch, placed in a cage directly on
being taken off the limed twig, and inadvertently left uncared for till
the evening, peck its toes until red flesh appeared, in his attempts to
rid them of the bird-lime attached to them. But whether the
song-bird&rsquo;s dislike to the lilac when in flower be owing to its
perfume or to the disagreeably glutinous exudations of its bark in
early summer, or to both combined, it is simply the fact that such an
aversion exists; and Allan Cunningham&rsquo;s objection to the lilac in
this connection is perfectly well founded. And even if this particular
objection had <i>not</i> been well founded, it would have been better,
we think, if Burns had selected some one or other of our native
flowering shrubs, such as the hawthorn, for example, rather than a
comparatively rare exotic like the lilac&mdash;rare now, and rarer
still a hundred years ago. If those who give any heed at all to these
matters will only consider the question, they will be ready, we think,
to confess that they never yet knew an instance of a bird&rsquo;s nest
in a lilac tree. About our own place here, where the lilac grows to a
large size, and flowers splendidly, we ourselves have never known or
heard of such a thing. Within the shelter of every other tree and shrub
of any consequence about the place, we have known our song-bird friends
to build at some time or other&mdash;never once in the lilac, nor, it
may be added, in the fuchsia, which in the warm shelter of this genial
spot grows to the dimensions of a tree, all the year round too, without
the slightest petting or special protection of any kind, as hardy and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>self-reliantly as its companion hawthorns,
hollies, and hazels. The fuchsia is probably avoided for the same
reason as the lilac. It also exudes in spring and early summer a viscid
secretion almost as &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; and disagreeable, if you run
your hand along a twig, as that of the lilac itself; and, as we have
already said, anything of this kind is an utter abomination to the
<i>Insessores</i> or perchers, who are as particular about their feet
and toes as ever was dainty and delicate <i>belle</i> about the state
of her hands and fingers.</p>
<p>Such of our readers as care about these things, and have the
opportunity, may very profitably and pleasantly give an occasional
half-hour to the doings of our song-birds at this season. Their little
love quarrels and rivalries are very amusing. All this forenoon a pair
of cock chaffinches have been bickering and quarrelling after their
fashion along the hedgerows and amongst the trees immediately opposite
our study window. The <i lang="la">casus belli</i> is of course a
female, handsome and coy, and fully conscious, you may believe, of her
own value, who keeps flitting about at a little distance, proud and
pleased, doubtless, to be the object of rivalry between a pair of such
gay and lively chaffinch beaux. <i lang="la">Varium et mutabile</i>,
she has evidently great difficulty in making up her mind as to which of
the suitors she shall select; her state of indecision being probably
akin to that of the renowned Captain Macheath in the <i>Beggar&rsquo;s
Opera</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;How happy could I be with either,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">Were t&rsquo;other dear charmer away!</p>
<p class="line">But while you thus tease me together,</p>
<p class="line xd26e978">To neither a word will I say.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The rival birds are in their gayest spring plumage;
and when tired of mere vulgar scolding and abuse, they try to sing each
other down; and then it is that they are well worth not merely the
listening to, but the looking at. Directly opposite the gean-tree near
the top of which the lady chaffinch sits preening her feathers,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>and occasionally uttering a <i>twink-twink</i>
of self-admiration, is an aged hawthorn, on which the rivals select to
hold their tournament of song; and the energy and heart with which a
bird sings in such a case must be seen and quietly studied to be fully
appreciated. Swaying lightly each on his own bough, the rivals begin to
sing as if their very lives depended upon it; their throats swollen
almost to bursting; the feathers on their polls erected into a crest,
and their whole bodies tremulous to the very tips of the quill feathers
of their wings, as they pour forth a torrent of song so rapid, clear,
and loud, that all the other birds in the neighbourhood are for the
moment silent, as if they had purposely ceased their own aimless
melodies to listen to the impassioned strains of the competitors in the
thorn. Of human eloquence, Quintilian says, &ldquo;<i lang="la">Pectus,
id est quod disertum facit</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the heart (and not the
brain) is that which makes a man eloquent; and even more than of
eloquence, with all the might of its &ldquo;winged words,&rdquo; is the
same thing true of song. To be all it ought to be, and be at its best,
it must well up a living stream from the hot, impassioned heart; not
from the marble fountain of mere intellect, which, if always clear, is
not the less always cold. If ever song came, in Quintilian&rsquo;s
phrase, direct <i lang="la">a pectore</i>&mdash;from the heart, it is
the song at this moment of the rival competitors in yonder thorn. It is
only when one has seen and studied a bird singing after this fashion
that the full force and meaning of a line in Gray&rsquo;s <i>Ode to
Spring</i> can be understood and appreciated. Under the lens of a cold,
critical analysis, the line is sheer nonsense; in sight of the bird
itself, as at this moment, singing with all his might, heart and soul
in every note, its truth and beauty are at once apparent. The line is
this&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The Attic <i>warbler pours her throat</i>,</p>
<p class="line">Responsive to the cuckoo&rsquo;s note.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Had not the poet seen, and closely and intelligently
observed, a bird in the act of loud and excited song, he would never
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>ventured on an assertion that at first sight
seems so curiously extravagant, that a warbler &ldquo;<i>pours her
throat</i>.&rdquo; It is to be observed, however, that the really
beautiful and expressive phrase is not original, but second-hand as
regards Gray. He borrows it from Pope, in whose <i>Essay on Man</i>
(Ep. iii.), published ten or a dozen years before Grays ode, occurs
this line&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Is it for thee the linnet <i>pours his
throat</i>?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But it is a pity to separate the line from its
context, and as the passage is not too well known, we may be pardoned
for quoting it:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Has God, thou fool! worked solely for thy
good,</p>
<p class="line">Thy joy, thy pastime, thy attire, thy food?</p>
<p class="line">Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn,</p>
<p class="line">For him as kindly spread the flowery lawn;</p>
<p class="line">Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings?</p>
<p class="line">Joy tunes his voice, joy elevates his wings.</p>
<p class="line"><i>Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat?</i></p>
<p class="line">Loves of his own, and raptures swell the note.</p>
<p class="line">The bounding steed you pompously bestride</p>
<p class="line">Shares with his lord the pleasure and the pride.</p>
<p class="line">Is thine alone the seed that strews the plain?</p>
<p class="line">The birds of heaven shall vindicate their grain.</p>
<p class="line">Thine the full harvest of the golden year?</p>
<p class="line">Part pays, and justly, the deserving steer:</p>
<p class="line">The hog, that ploughs not, nor obeys thy call,</p>
<p class="line">Lives on the labours of this Lord of all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It will be seen that Gray makes his
nightingale&mdash;his &ldquo;Attic warbler&rdquo;&mdash;feminine,
&ldquo;pours <i>her</i> throat,&rdquo; while Pope, more correctly,
makes his linnet songster a mate, &ldquo;pours <i>his</i>
throat;&rdquo; and Pope who, indeed, from his habits of life, must have
known more about birds than Gray, is right, for it is the males of
song-birds that sing, and not the females. Milton makes the same
mistake as Gray, and adds to the blunder by saying that the nightingale
sings &ldquo;the summer long,&rdquo; which it does not. It is curious
that our English poets should so frequently err, as Gray did, in
attributing the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409"
name="pb409">409</a>]</span>melodies of song-birds to the females
instead of to the males. The explanation, we suppose, is that, as
amongst ourselves women as a rule are more musically inclined, and
usually have sweeter voices than men, even so the poets, knowing no
better, rashly conclude that the rule must hold good amongst song-birds
also. The very contrary, however, is the fact. It is the male bird that
always sings; the female attempts at song being extremely rare, and
when attempted always a failure, never for a moment to be compared with
the rich and long-sustained melodies of the male. Of all our
song-birds, the most frequently mentioned by the poets is, of course,
the nightingale, and almost invariably they make it a &ldquo;she&rdquo;
instead of a &ldquo;he.&rdquo; One of the finest passages in English
poetry is a reference to the nightingale in <i>The Lover&rsquo;s
Melancholy</i> of the dramatist John Ford (d. 1639). We are fond of
reciting this passage when &ldquo;i&rsquo; the vein&rdquo; for such
things, but we always take the liberty of changing the
&ldquo;she,&rdquo; &ldquo;hers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; of Ford,
into the &ldquo;he,&rdquo; &ldquo;his,&rdquo; and &ldquo;him&rdquo; of
ornithological fact. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410"

Leonis</i>&mdash;Zodiacal Light&mdash;Snow Bunting&mdash;Old Gaelic
Ballad of &ldquo;Deirdri:&rdquo; Its Topography.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If for the first few days March [1878] seemed inclined
to emulate the peaceful calm and sunshine of its predecessor, it very
suddenly assumed a more warlike aspect; a change came over the spirit
of its dream; it became boisterous and rude; snow, and sleet, and rain,
and storm battling in wild comminglement. It still continued what is
called &ldquo;open&rdquo; weather, however; there was no frost, no
razor-edged and biting winds, and vegetation was rather temporarily
checked than seriously hurt or hindered. After this wild burst, in
vindication, it is to be presumed, of the month&rsquo;s right to be
called after the bellicose Mars, things slowly but steadily improved,
and the weather is now such as permits us to get on with our spring
work uninterruptedly and pleasantly enough. We have not yet, however,
had a sufficiency of the &ldquo;March dust,&rdquo; so proverbially
invaluable at seed-time; and nowhere perhaps so invaluable, so
absolutely essential indeed, in its proper season, as in the West
Highlands. The day, however, is now lengthening apace, and with a
bright warm sun overhead, and brisk north-easterly breezes, we shall
doubtless soon have dust enough and to spare.</p>
<p>Our reference to Mars the war-god, reminds us that Mars the planet,
with whose fiery effulgence every one is familiar, has recently had an
accession of dignity such as the old-world star-gazers never dreamt of
in connection with the ruddy orb. It is found to have at least two
attendant moons, small, and so exceedingly difficult of detection even
by the aid of the best instruments, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb411" href="#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span>that it is only under
the most favourable circumstances that they can be observed. It is more
than suspected that a third, and even a fourth satellite, exists, and
the planet will in consequence be subjected to the closest possible
scrutiny at all the observatories at home and abroad for some time to
come, in order to determine with certainty the number of its attendant
moons, and whether they be two or more, to decide their sidereal
revolutions, their diameters, masses, and inclinations of orbits. By
reason of his retinue of satellites, Mars is now exalted to equal
dignity with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; and by the discovery
another point is scored in favour of the nebular hypothesists. It was
on the night of the 1st January 1801 that the first of the planetoids,
<i>Ceres</i>, was discovered by Piazzi of Palermo. Next year Olbers of
Bremen discovered the second planetoid, <i>Pallas</i>, and so constant
and searching has been the scrutiny to which the planetoidal zone,
situated between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, has been subjected,
that the number of these minor worlds is now no less than 182, the last
three in the series, Nos. 180, 181, and 182, having been discovered
since the beginning of February last. Of these three, two were
discovered by French observers; the third by Professor Peters of
Hamilton College, U.S., America. This last, however, is suspected to be
only a rediscovery, so to speak; to be identical with <i>Antigone</i>,
discovered five years ago by the same indefatigable observer. If this
be so, the asteroidal series amounts at present date to 181. In favour
of the ingenious hypothesis that accounted for the existence of these
minor orbs by suggesting that they might be the fragments of a large
disrupted world&mdash;of a large planet rent asunder by some terrible
internal convulsion&mdash;a great deal could be said while the number
of fragments was under half a dozen or even double that number, but
when the fleet of orblets began to be counted by the score, the
disrupted world theory was dropped as no longer tenable in the
circumstances. The hypothesis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412"
href="#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span>of Olbers, however&mdash;for
it originated with the discoverer of <i>Pallas</i>&mdash;led to a great
deal of curious research that resulted in no little gain to
astronomical science; and if it had to be given up as insufficient in
the case of a planetoidal zone, it left us a legacy that may yet be
turned to good account, that such a catastrophe, namely, as the
disruption of a planetary world into fragments that in the shape of
minor orbs would continue to revolve in orbits coincident with that of
the parent globe, is not only possible, but, under certain easily
enough conceivable circumstances, a probable enough occurrence.</p>
<p>Occultations by the moon of planets and first magnitude stars are
always interesting phenomena, and for many years we have rarely missed
observing such conjunctions as they became due, even if the hour was
otherwise inconvenient, if only the weather chanced to be favourable.
Last week there were two occultations, which for particular reasons we
were very anxious to observe, and as the weather was clear and bright
we had but little fear of disappointment. The stars to be occulted were
<i>Alpha</i> and <i>Delta</i> Leonis, the one on the night of the 16th,
the other on the night succeeding. <i>Alpha</i> Leonis is of the first
magnitude, distinguished, like some others of its class, from the mere
alphabetical order of stars by its proper name of <i>Regulus</i>. Up to
within a quarter of an hour of the computed moment of occultation or
disappearance of the star behind the moon&rsquo;s disc, the sky was
clear; and as we stood at our post everything promised a highly
satisfactory and successful observation; but alas, as the moon and
star, in nautical phrase, were close aboard each other, a huge bank of
cloud, driven by a north-westerly breeze, swept over the scene,
effectually occulting moon and stars alike from the most penetrating
gaze. It was provoking enough, but there was no help for it. An
observer in our climate must make up his mind to frequent
disappointments of this kind. We were still in hopes that although the
immersion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>was thus hidden from us we might be more
fortunate in the case of the emersion&mdash;the reappearance, that
is&mdash;of the star on the moon&rsquo;s western limb. But it was no
use. Two or three times, indeed, the moon shone forth for a minute or
two together from through an old cathedral porch-like rent in the
intervening wall of cloud, but only to be again obscured; and thus it
continued so tantalisingly promising, that we stood to our post until a
glance at the clock showed that the moment of emersion was already
past, and it was useless waiting or watching any longer. The great
object in closely watching these occultations is to observe, with all
possible certainty, if there is any distortion or momentary projection
on the moon&rsquo;s disc of the planet or star occulted at the instant
of immersion and emersion, in order to decide if the moon has an
atmosphere or not. We have seen enough, we think, from our own
observations during the last five and twenty years, to lead us to the
conclusion that such distortion and projection is occasionally to be
seen, and that therefore, contrary to the general belief of
astronomers, a lunar atmosphere very probably exists, though it may be
of greatly less weight and density than our own. Looking over our
<span class="corr" id="xd26e8831" title=
"Source: astonomical">astronomical</span> note-book, we find that the
winter just past&mdash;let us hope that at this date we may so speak of
it&mdash;was remarkable for two things&mdash;the almost total absence,
namely, of auroral displays, and the exceeding brilliancy of the
zodiacal light. We have only two recorded instances of the occurrence
of the aurora borealis, both in December, and both but partial, faint,
and ill-defined. The zodiacal light, on the contrary, was remarkably
bright and noticeable on almost every evening in February and early
March, its apex reaching up to and beyond the Pleiades, and with an
outline clear and sharply defined as ever was sheaf of the brightest
auroral light. So noticeable was it on several occasions, that all the
people of the hamlet began to speak about it, and inquire what it could
mean, for its perfect quiescence, its appearance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span>night after night in the same quarter of the
heavens, and the absence of anything like accompanying storms or aerial
disturbance, satisfied even them that it was not the <i>fir-chlis</i>
or &ldquo;merry-dancers&rdquo; as they used to know them. Let us assure
our Celtic readers that an attempt on our part to explain the nature of
the zodiacal light in <i>Gaelic</i> was no easy task; and if the truth
were known, we fear our prelection <i lang="la">quoad hoc</i> was a sad
failure.</p>
<p>We have received the following note from &ldquo;A Constant
Reader:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Nether Lochaber.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;Would you kindly let us know, through the columns
of the <i>Inverness Courier</i>, the proper name of the accompanying
little bird, and what part of this country it is properly a native of.
It is never seen in Ross-shire but during very heavy snow, and then
they fly about in large flocks, and disappear again as soon as the snow
is gone.&mdash;I am, yours respectfully,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">A Constant Reader</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neatly packed in a couple of lucifer match-boxes ingeniously
conjoined, the bird reached us, and the <i>locale</i> of its being shot
or captured we can only approximately indicate by the fact that the
package bore the post-mark &ldquo;Garve.&rdquo; There was no difficulty
in at once recognising the bird as the snow-fleck or snow bunting, the
<i lang="la">Emberiza nivalis</i> of Linn&aelig;us, a common enough
bird in early winter over the whole of Scotland. Although it has been
known to breed in Scotland, a few being found all the year round along
the summits of the Grampians, and other mountain ranges to the north
and north-west, it is probably a bird of considerably higher latitudes
than ours; visiting our shores as a migrant in October or November,
according as the winter is early and severe or otherwise, and leaving
us again in March or April. It is a hardy little bird, of plain and
rather sombre plumage, prettiest in the act of flight, when the white
on the edges and tips of the tail-feathers, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>quills, and secondaries, comes out in pretty
bars, contrasting pleasantly with the dark and chestnut brown, which
may be said to be the prevailing colour. The snow-fleck has hardly any
song beyond a tremulous twittering, and a few call-notes so loud and
shrill that in the strange and solemn calm that sometimes precedes a
snow-storm, they may be heard at a great distance. Our correspondent
should have stated where, when, and how the bird was got, a knowledge
of such matters vastly enhancing the interest and value of a specimen,
especially if it has any claims to be accounted a <i lang="la">rara
avis</i>.</p>
<p>We are indebted to our excellent Celtic friend, Mr. William Mackay,
Inverness, for a copy of his exceedingly interesting monograph on
<i>The Glen and Castle of Urquhart</i>, one of the most interesting
spots in the Highlands. Mr. Mackay attempts to make Glen Urquhart
classic ground by associating the story of Dearduil and
Clann-Uisneachean, as related in the medi&aelig;val Gaelic ballads,
with the locality, by pointing out that there is a Dun <i>Dearduil</i>
in the neighbourhood&mdash;a place so called after the hapless heroine
of the ballad story. But in the old and unquestionably authentic
ballads her name is not Dearduil but <i>Deirdri</i>; <i>Deirdir</i> and
<i>Daordir</i>. Dearduil is a much later form of the name, not older,
Mr. J. F. Campbell hints, than the Darthula of &ldquo;Ossian&rdquo;
Macpherson. But there are other Dun Dearduils besides that referred to
by Mr. Mackay; one, for instance, near us in Glenevis; and it is to be
observed that all the places so called are vitrified forts. An old man
in our neighbourhood, one of our best <i>seannachies</i>, always speaks
of the Glenevis vitrified fort as Dun <i>Dearsail</i> or
<i>Dearsuil</i>, and this is probably the correct form of the term,
closely connecting it with <i>dears</i> and <i>dearsadh</i>, to shine,
a shining; to beam and be effulgently aglow like flame of <i>fire</i>.
Remembering that <i>all</i> the places so called present more or less
marked traces of vitrifaction, in the formation of which <i>fire</i>
and <i>flame</i>, on a large scale, must <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb416" href="#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>have been the chief
and most remarkable agents, the name comes to have a fitting and
appropriate enough meeting, without the necessity of taking in the name
of Deirdri or Dearduil at all. Mr. Mackay next gives a translation of a
couple of quatrains from the oldest known version of the
Clann-Uisneachan ballad; that, namely, of the vellum manuscript in the
Advocates&rsquo; Library, bearing the date 1238, and quoted in the
Highland Society&rsquo;s Report on <i>Ossian</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e1751">&ldquo;Beloved land, that eastern land,</p>
<p class="line xd26e3677">Alba, with its lakes;</p>
<p class="line xd26e1751">Oh, that I might not depart from it;</p>
<p class="line xd26e3677">But I go with <i>Naois</i>.</p>
<p class="line xd26e1751">Glen Urchain, O Glen Urchain,</p>
<p class="line">It was the straight glen of smooth ridges:</p>
<p class="line">Not more joyful was a man of his age</p>
<p class="line xd26e1751">Than Naois in Glen Urchain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Mr. Mackay will have it, of course, that this
&ldquo;Glen-Urchain&rdquo; is his Glen Urquhart. The Gaelic name of
Urquhart, however, is invariably a trisyllable; but this apart, the
Glen-<i>Urchain</i> of Mr. Mackay has no existence in the ballad from
which he professes to translate. The quatrain stands thus in the
original:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="gd" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mo chen Glen Urchaidh,</p>
<p class="line">Ba hedh in Glen direach dromchain;</p>
<p class="line">Uallcha feara aoisi</p>
<p class="line">Ma Naise an Glend Urchaidh.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is Glen <i>Urchaidh</i>, observe, not
<i>Urchain</i>; the Glenurchay of Argyllshire, in short, not the Glen
Urquhart or Urchadan of Inverness-shire. This is further proved by the
context, the immediately preceding and succeeding stanzas, which speak
of Glen Mason and Glendaruel in Cowal; of Duntroon; of Innisstrynich on
Loch Awe; of Eite or Etive, &amp;c. In so far, in short, as this story
of Clann-Uisneachan of Ireland has to do with Scotland, we find it
connected with Argyllshire, where indeed we should most naturally look
for it; and chiefly with Glen Etive and Loch <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>Etive, where we have Dun-Mhac-Uisneachan;
Grianan Dheirdir; Caoille Naois; Eilean Uisneachan, &amp;c. &amp;c. In
Argyllshire, too, it was that the Clann-Uisneachan ballads were
preserved till discovered and taken down from oral recitation by the
collectors. And if Dun-Dearduil and &ldquo;Glen-Urchain&rdquo; must be
given up as having no connection with the ballads in question, so would
it seem to follow that some other etymology than any connection with
the name of <i>Naois</i>, must be found for Loch <i>Ness</i>,
Inver<i>ness</i>, &amp;c.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
